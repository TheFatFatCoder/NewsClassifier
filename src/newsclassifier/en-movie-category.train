National Bandung Zoo in West Java and Surakarta Zoo in Central Java are set to exchange Javan rusa deer for breeding purposes.Of the 15 deer at Bandung Zoo, three males will be sent to Surakarta Zoo in exchange for one male and two females. “An earlier study on the Bogor Palace’s collection of spotted deer suggested that to prevent inbreeding, [the palace] would need 400 more deer. Bandung Zoo didn’t have enough deer to prevent inbreeding, that’s why we are exchanging deer,” Bandung Zoo curator Panji Ahmad Fauzan said in Bandung on Friday.Inbreeding increases the chances of offspring being affected by deleterious or undesired recessive traits.“We are exchanging deer to prevent [their offspring] from being affected by harmful traits. Every conservation body needs to do this,” he said.Bandung Zoo marketing communications officer Sulhan Syafi’i said an exchange agreement was signed in November 2017. However, the plan only materialized in May.“We were waiting for approval from the Natural Resources and Ecosystem Directorate General because the deer are a protected animal,” Sulhan said.Bandung Zoo also agreed to give Surakarta Zoo a 9-year-old female sun bear as a gift.The animals will be transported at night to prevent them from suffering from dehydration.

National The National Police arrested eight terror suspects in connection with the attack on the Riau Police headquarters in Pekanbaru.On Thursday, National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian said the eight were connected to Jamaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD).Earlier on Wednesday, National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said the suspects in the Riau Police attack, which killed one officer, were part of the Islamic State of Indonesia (NII), not JAD.“All [recent] terror attacks have a connection to the JAD group because we have monitored its development over the last four years,” Tito said on the sidelines of his visit to Riau Police headquarters. He added that the purpose of the planned amendment to the 2003 Terrorism Law, along with a request for the improvement of detention centers and penitentiaries, was to anticipate the growth of the terror group.Tito visited Pekanbaru to promote police officers involved in stopping Wednesday’s attack.

National A panel of judges at the Jakarta Corruption Court has sentenced former Transportation Ministry sea transportation director general Antonius Tonny Budiono to five years in prison for accepting bribes related to the issuance of harbor dredging permits. "[The judges hereby] order the defendant to pay Rp 300 million [US$21,339] in fines or face an additional three months in prison,” said presiding judge Saifuddin Zuhri as quoted by Antara when he read out the verdict in a hearing on Thursday. Corruption Eradication Commission prosecutors had sought seven years in prison for Tonny, but the judges gave him a lesser sentence following the prosecutors' decision to grant the defendant justice collaborator status. The former director general stated that he accepted the verdict and would not file for an appeal. Antonius was declared guilty of accepting Rp 2.3 billion from Adi Putra Kurniawan, a commissioner of dredging company PT Adhi Guna Keruktama, in relation to dredging permits for several harbors where the company operates, including Tanjung Emas Port in Semarang, Central Java. The businessman is currently serving a four-year prison sentence as he was declared guilty in a separate case. Graft busters found Adi had agreed to wire the money for the director general to new bank accounts the former had set up under the false identity of Joko Prabowo, a combination of the names of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and his political rival Prabowo Subianto. Antonius was also declared guilty on Thursday of accepting unlawful gifts valued at around Rp 8.42 billion and US$1 million. (kuk/ebf)
National Sr. Adj. Comr. Roni Faisal Saiful Fatoni is the head of Surabaya Police’s narcotics division. Recently, however, he has received an avalanche of praise from across the country, not for taking down drug dealers, but for rescuing a child from the smoldering wreckage of a bomb detonated by her own parents – a bomb that was meant to kill him and his colleagues. On Monday morning, Roni and several other police officers were on standby at their office trying to make sense of a spate of terror attacks that had struck the city the day before. The Surabaya Police were aware that they could very well be the terrorists’ next target, so heavier security was placed around their headquarters. Their instincts may have saved the lives of many police officers, as that Monday morning, five people on two motorcycles approached the headquarters’ main entrance at high speed. Mere seconds after stopping at the security gates, as ordered by officers, the bombs strapped to their bodies went off, throwing nearby personnel to the ground. Four people on the motorcycles were killed instantly, but an 8-year-old girl – the daughter of the perpetrators – survived. Amid the panic, with flames and smoke still billowing from the site of the explosion, the young girl could be seen rising unsteadily to her feet. She tried to move away from the ruins but was unable to walk due to her injuries. Without knowing whether a second bomb was set to go off or, worse, whether the child had explosives strapped to her body, Roni rushed toward the girl and scooped her up in his arms to take her to safety. "I have a daughter exactly her age. My immediate instinct was to save this little girl," Roni said in a recent interview with Kompas.TV. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, East Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Machfud Arifin said: “If there had been a bomb tied to the child’s belly, I would have lost my narcotics division head.” Footage of Roni’s daring move quickly made the rounds on TV news outlets as well as social media platforms. Netizens responded by praising his actions as “heroic”, with many lauding him for saving the child without hesitation and at the risk of his own life. Praise was also directed at the National Police for their swift actions in handling the terrorist threats when they themselves had become a target. "Feeling touched. Thanks Pak Roni for saving her," @Anaa said on Twitter. Flower boards with messages supporting the police can still be seen around the East Java Police headquarters. "We support the police in keeping NKRI [the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia] safe," one message reads.(ebf)

National Presidential Chief of Staff Moeldoko claimed that President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo had expressed his consent to bringing back to life the suspended military Joint Special Operations Command (Koopsusgab) tasked with countering terrorism. The team, which included and will again include personnel of the Army’s Special Forces (Kopassus), the Navy’s Denjaka specialized squad and the Air Force’s Bravo 90 special force, would be put on standby and be ready to be mobilized at any time when terror threats emerged, Moeldoko said. “This joint force was well trained and prepared in terms of its capacity, and it could be deployed anywhere on the country’s soil as fast as possible [...]. Its role would be to assist the National Police,” Moeldoko said on Wednesday. His statement followed a recent string of terrorist attacks that has thrust the country into a state of paranoia. The joint force was first established under Moeldoko when he served as the Indonesian Military (TNI) commander in 2015. The special command’s operations, however, were suspendedly under the leadership of Moeldoko’s successor, Gen (ret.) Gatot Nurmantyo. Further tasks of the special command would be discussed between TNI commander Air Chief Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto and National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian, with the latter to have the final say on whether it needed the assistance of the TNI’s special team or not, Moeldoko said. “This operation must be carried out for preventive purposes, so that the public can feel safe […]. We [the security apparatus] are ready to face any kind of situation, so people should put their trust in us and not worry,” he said. The revitalization of the joint force did not require any new regulations, Moeldoko said, adding that the details about the command’s tasks would be adjusted with the planned amendment to the 2003 Terrorism Law. The announcement came as the House of Representatives and the government began to clear up contentious articles that had caused deadlock in the deliberation of the Terrorism Law revision, including the legal definition of terrorism and the military’s level of involvement in counterterrorism operations. A greater level of involvement has stirred debate among experts and human rights activists. Seven ruling parties and the government had agreed on a definition of terrorism that included acts that had “political and ideological motives and threaten national security”, United Development Party (PPP) lawmaker Arsul Sani said. It is widely believed that such a definition would provide leeway for greater involvement of the TNI in counterterrorism efforts. As the government and the lawmakers appear to be on the same page now, observers expect the bill to be passed into law in the near future. Jokowi has recently said he would issue a regulation in lieu of law (Perppu) on the Terrorism Law if the House failed to conclude deliberations on the bill by June. Members of a committee tasked with deliberating the bill said it was the leading opposition Gerindra Party and the Democratic Party, both political parties with strong military influence, that had demanded the inclusion of the contentious provisions. “We support [the terrorism bill],” Gerindra chairman Prabowo Subianto said during his visit to the House on Wednesday. Deliberation of the bill is believed to have been stalled mainly because of a tug of war between the TNI and the police, which led to division among political parties factions into pro-TNI and pro-police camps.
National Lucia Cicilia Agan has kept her cellphone close to her for the past few days because she has been waiting for news from a police hospital in Surabaya about her cousin, Aloysius Bayu Rendra Wardhana, 38, who was among the victims who fell to church bombings in Surabaya on May 13. “We’re still waiting for [results from] the DNA identification process in Jakarta. On Tuesday morning, DNA samples of Bayu’s child and father were taken to Jakarta,” Cicilia told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. Of a total of 13 victims of the Surabaya church attacks, Bayu, the last victim to be identified, was the only one that had not been returned to the family. Bayu died at the Saint Mary Immaculate (SMTB) Catholic Church of Surabaya in Ngagel, where he was the leader of the church’s youth group. When the bombing took place, he acted as the head of a group of security volunteers. Bayu tried to stand in the way of a suicide bomber who drove a speeding motorcycle into the church. “His wife and his mom were in a deep sadness. They don’t have the energy to wait for this DNA process [to finish]. So I’m the one who takes care of this at the police station,” Cicilia said. Bayu had a 3-month-old baby. The family is now waiting to have the body returned so they can hold a funeral for Bayu. East Java Police medical unit head Sr. Comr. Budi Heryadi said the process took a long time because of the state Bayu’s body was in as a result of the explosion from two suicide bombers, Dita Oepriarto’s 18-year-old and 16-year-old sons. Sadness also clouded another family of victims of the same church attack, during the funeral of Vincentius Evan Hudojo, 11, and Nathanael Ethan Hudojo, 8. Their mother, Wenny Angelina, was wounded in the explosion. She gently sprinkled perfume on her sons’ bodies and put the young boys’ favorite things in their coffins, including a toy gun, clothes and hats. Prayers and weeping were heard at the funeral home on Jl. Demak in Surabaya on Wednesday. Wenny came to the funeral home with medical equipment attached to her body. She was not in a stable physical condition and had to return to the hospital quickly after the ceremony to have bomb shrapnel removed from her body. On the tragic Sunday, Wenny and her two sons, heading for Mass at the church, had just exited their car when the motorcycle sped past them and the explosion hit. Evan, the older brother, died first while Nathan died later in the evening at the hospital. Evan and Nathan were laid down to rest in the Keputih cemetary, where a number of other bombing victims were buried. (evi)

National The son of a Surabaya bombing victim has said that the family had forgiven those responsible, during the funeral for his mother, Lim, who was killed in the blast at Saint Mary Immaculate (SMTB) Catholic Church on Sunday. Kurnianto arrived on Monday at Bhayangkara Police Hospital along with his father and siblings to take his mother’s body home to Tangerang, Banten, reported kompas.com. His voice shaking, “On behalf of my mother, I apologize if she made any mistakes during her life, and please pray for her, she is now in heaven,” he said on Monday as quoted by kompas.com. “And as for the perpetrators, we forgive them and I believe my mother is in the House of the Lord.” Kurnianto said his mother was on a business trip to Surabaya with her friends, Siska and Susana, to take part in a batik exhibition. They were staying in a hotel that was actually closer to Surabaya Cathedral than SMTB church. “But this is perhaps God’s way. She went to the church in Ngagel instead, which people say is one of the oldest churches in Surabaya,” he said. According to the CCTV footage he had seen, Kurnianto said his mother was right next to the bomber’s motorcycle in front of the church when the bomb detonated. “When I saw the CCTV, I don’t know, perhaps it was God’s beautiful plan. When Mama arrived at the gate, she did not enter the church [and] she stayed there about five minutes,” he said. Kurnianto said he trusted the nation’s security apparatus and that they had been diligent. “My message to the public [is]: Please don’t judge any religions, because no religion asks [the believers] to do evil things. We believe the government has done their best for the nation and stated. And finally, God please help Indonesia,” Kurnianto said. (evi)

National The Communications and Information Ministry has intensified its effort to identify and block online content related to radicalism and terrorism in the wake of a series of terror attacks in Surabaya, East Java, and other regions. “I have given the instruction to monitor the content of websites using a crawling method every two hours. Should we find suspicious content, we will block it right away,” Communications and Information Minister Rudiantara said after a meeting with representatives of social media platforms on Tuesday. He further said the crawling was expected to yield results, even if there were few websites with radical content. The government is searching for content that is deemed provocative, promotes terrorism or exacerbates the current state of terror. The ministry said that, as of Tuesday, it had blocked social media accounts for spreading terror-related content – most of which was posted on 450 Facebook and Instagram accounts. “Some of them were previously identified but we had not yet blocked them because they were still subject to investigations conducted by the police or the BNPT [National Counterterrorism Agency],” Rudiantara said. Rudiantara further said the ministry would ask social media platforms to deactivate the accounts after the investigations. Such a commitment was echoed by representatives of Facebook Indonesia who stated that the platform would follow up on any complaints from users and the ministry regarding negative content. “We have no room for violence,” said Facebook Indonesia public policy head Ruben Hattari, who was present at the meeting. He, however, did not provide an exact time frame as to when the blocking would be conducted, saying the platform received many complaints every day. The online measure will be supported by an artificial intelligence tool that will crawl websites based on keywords. Initially, the government used this tool to stop hoaxes and block pornographic content on the internet. (ebf)

He mentioned several famous names like former Jakarta governor Djarot Saiful Hidayat and the Home Ministry’s regional autonomy director general, Sumarsono, who once was an acting Jakarta governor during the city’s gubernatorial election last year. “Most of them were surprised. Even Djarot asked, ‘Wow, you’ve got a lot of tools here’, to which I replied with simple, ‘Yes, sir’,” Hendra said. “While having coffee here, [my friends and I] never talk about work. They come in, I make them coffee, we chat and joke around, and then we go home,” he added, noting that Deputy Governor Sandiaga Uno had also enjoyed his coffee after lunch a couple days ago. According to Ottencoffee.co.id, a popular e-commerce platform that sells everything any coffee enthusiast needs, the tools and equipment in Hendra’s office cost millions of rupiah. A French press costs about Rp 350,000 (US$24.90) to Rp 810,000. A regular coffee maker, meanwhile, costs approximately Rp 1 million. One of the most expensive equipment that Hendra has is his espresso machine, which ranges from Rp 5 million to hundreds of millions of rupiah.
City The Pasar Minggu Fire and Rescue Agency responded to a call from a group of workers who asked for their help to remove a wasp nest they discovered on Thursday evening at the Ragunan Sports Center in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta. “A big wasp nest was found right at the gate to the sports center, which is dangerous. [The workers] discovered the nest when they went to paint the gate for the Asian Games,” said head of Pasar Minggu Fire and Rescue Agency Ardianysah as quoted by wartakota.tribunnews.com on Friday. “The workers were afraid that they would be stung by the wasps,” he added, and that the nest was 30 centimeters in diameter. “We deployed our officers last night and found no difficulties in removing the nest,” said Ardianysah.

City Prosecutors have demanded that pro-Islamic State (IS) cleric Aman Abdurrahman be sentenced to death for allegedly inspiring a series of terror attacks on Indonesian soil. “We demand that the panel of judges […] find Oman Rochman, alias Aman Abdurrahman, alias Abu Sulaiman, guilty of committing an act of terrorism […] and sentence him to death,” said prosecutor Anita Dewayani. The prosecution team made the sentence demand at the South Jakarta District Court during Friday's hearing, when they also read out the indictment against Aman. Aman, widely known as the influential jihadi ideologue among Islamist militants grouped under the local Jamaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD) terror group, has been accused of inspiring at least three major terror attacks in 2016 and 2017. The attacks include the Jan. 14, 2016 Thamrin bombing and shootout that killed four people, the Nov. 13, 2016 Samarinda church bombing that killed a toddler, and the May 25, 2017 Kampung Melayu twin bombings that killed three policemen. A JAD member testified in court that Aman had inspired the establishment of the radical group, which is said to be the largest pro-IS group in the country. The JAD has been blamed for the recent string of terror attacks in the past several days, including the deadly riot at the National Police’s Mobile Brigade headquarters (Mako Brimob) in Depok, West Java, and a series of bombings that killed at least 13 people in Surabaya and Sidoarjo, East Java. Aman, who was being held in a separate block at the Mako Brimob detention center from the instigators of the riot, reportedly played a role in ending the 36-hour standoff between terror inmates and police. The standoff on May 8-9 ensued after 10 terror inmates linked to JAD killed five members of the police’s Densus 88 elite counterterrorism squad and took one other member hostage following the initial riot, which then escalated. The hearing was originally scheduled for Friday a week ago, but prosecutors were unable to gain access to the detention center to transport Aman to the courthouse, as the police had locked down the facility in the aftermath of the incident.

City Private-owned water company PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (Palyja) has announced that the company’s water production level may decrease because of the lowered water discharge on the West Flood Canal, one of Palyja's sources of water, during the dry season. The company said its production would be lowered to 200-300 liters per second for an indefinite period of time in several areas. “Palyja will redistribute water and coordinate with the city owned water company PAM Jaya and the Jakarta administration to anticipate disturbances to the customer’s water supply,” Palyja spokesperson Lydia Astriningworo said in a written statement on Thursday. Lydia said that PAM Jaya had recommended the administration to control the water level of the West Flood Canal using the water gates in Karet, South Jakarta. Lydia said that Palyja had prepared water tanks for emergencies at hospitals and places of worship as well as several of Palyja’s service areas. The affected areas include Manggarai Selatan, Manggarai, Menteng Atas, Pasar Manggis, Guntur, Pegangsaan, Cikini, Mangga Dua Selatan and Gelora in Central Jakarta. In West Jakarta affected areas include Mangga Besar, Tangki, Tomang, Grogol, Pinangsia, Palmerah, Kemanggisan, Angke, Kali Anyar, Jembatan Besi, Suka Bumi Utara, Duri Kepa, Tanjung Duren Selatan, Tanjung Duren Utara, Kedoya Selatan, Kebon Jeruk, Jelambar Baru, Wijaya Kusuma and Jelambar. In South Jakarta affected areas are Grogol Selatan and Grogol Utara while in North Jakarta, Ancol, Pekojan, Roa Malaka, Pejagalan and Pluit have been affected. Also affected are Pancoran, Bukit Duri and Kampung Melayu in East Jakarta and other surrounding areas. “We apologize for any trouble and inconvenience,” Lydia said. (ami)
City The South Jakarta District Court beefed up security on Friday for the trial of pro-Islamic State (IS) cleric and ideologue Aman Abdurrahman. Aman is known as the spiritual leader of Jamaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD), the nation's largest pro-IS terrorist group blamed for a string of terrorist attacks across Indonesia in recent years, including the Surabaya bombings that killed at least 13 people. Aman is standing trial for his alleged role in masterminding the Jan. 14, 2016, Thamrin attacks in Central Jakarta. The prosecutors are expected to read their sentence demand on Friday’s hearing. The Jakarta Police deployed 152 officers to secure the court. They were backed up by some 30 military personnel. All court visitors are required show their identity cards and undergo security screenings before entering the court. South Jakarta Police chief Sr. Comr. Indra Jafar said the police had deployed armed officers to monitor activities inside and outside the court. Police bomb squad Gegana has cleared the court room in which the hearing will be conducted, he said. Other hearings have been postponed to optimize the security measures. "The court will only hold one hearing [Aman's court hearing] until Friday's prayer. After that, the court will hold about two other hearings," Indra said. (ahw)
City The Jakarta administration has ordered 251 nightclubs, bars and other venues in West Jakarta to stop operating during Ramadhan. West Jakarta Culture and Tourism Agency head Linda Enriany said those venues should stop operating to honor Muslims who were fasting. “They should have been closed a day before Ramadhan. We will monitor them,” Linda said on Thursday, as quoted by kompas.com. She added that the Jakarta administration had explained Gubernatorial Regulation No. 18/2018 on tourism business to the business owners. However, karaoke and poolrooms are excluded from the regulation. Executive karaoke pubs can operate from  8:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., while family karaokes, which are prohibited from selling alcoholic beverages, can operate from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. Poolrooms can operate from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m., while poolrooms inside a karaoke lounge or pub can operate from 8:30 p.m. to 1.30 a.m. Nightclubs -- which are located in a commercial area or minimum four-star hotel and far from residential areas, schools, hospitals and houses of worship -- will operate normally. Linda said the agency would issue warning letters to entertainment establishments that violated the regulation. Should those places repeat the violations three times, the city administration would shut them down, she added. (cal)
City Dozens of residents living near the Bantar Gebang landfill in Bekasi, West Java, have threatened to forcefully close down the facility -- owned by the Jakarta administration -- should they not be paid compensation as promised by the facility’s management by next week. The residents, who visited the landfill’s management office on Wednesday, said they had yet to receive compensation called uang bau (literally meaning smelly money) from the management, which should be paid every three months to residents. Each household living near the landfill was promised Rp 200,000 (US$14) in monthly compensation for living with the smell of garbage. “We will see by Monday. Today we are only giving a warning [to the management],” said a local resident, Tajiri, as quoted by tempo.co. He added that tens of thousands Bantar Gebang residents only wanted what was rightfully theirs. “We don’t care how they disburse the money. We only want to receive the money on time.” Nearly 18,000 people in three villages around Bantar Gebang (TPST Bantar Gebang) have been living amid the lingering stench of trash since the landfill was established three decades ago to receive waste from Jakarta. Separately, a senior official at the Bekasi administration, Dadang Hidayat, said the delay in payment was caused by “technical and administrative problems”. Therefore, to meet the residents’ demands, the administration plans to use the Bekasi city budget to pay the uang bau allocations. “Hopefully, the compensation can be channeled to the residents next Friday,” Dadang said.

City About 1,600 tons of trash under the Pelabuhan toll road in Warakas subdistrict in Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, has been removed by the city’s sanitary workers after 28 days. The Tanjung Priok environment unit head, Basrudin, said the trash could only be cleared manually because the location is inaccessible to garbage trucks. Kompas.com reported on Thursday that the heap of trash had been removed, but some still remained behind. Basrudin said the waste could only be removed by heavy equipment. “It’s hard to clear the waste manually. However, there is no access for heavy equipment here.” Basrudin said he hoped PT Citra Marga Nusaphala Persada, the toll road developer and owner of the land, would erect a fence to prevent people from dumping their waste on the land. City workers would continue to monitor the land and clear the waste, he added. A recent report stated that the trash had been accumulating in the space for the past two decades, ever since the toll road was constructed in 1993. The joint team consisting of 310 personnel from the Indonesian Military (TNI), Public Facility Maintenance Agency (PPSU) and the environment agency, cleared the land by using three-wheeled garbage motorcycles.

City The security alert at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang regency, Banten, remains at Siaga 1, which is the highest level, following a wave of terror attacks in Indonesia over the past few days. The Jakarta Police have deployed 10 teams to secure the terminals and Transit Oriented Development (TOD) building. They have also intensified their monitoring of the curbside, non-terminal buildings and terminal parking lot building. The police are being assisted by 4,020 joint personnel of Aviation Security (AvSec), the military operational control aid (BKO) and security guards. All activities are being monitored by 1,900 CCTV cameras installed in the airport. “We are united in the fight against terrorism and are conducting walking patrols along the curbside, non-terminal and office buildings near the entry and exit gates,” Tommy Hadi Bawono, the senior manager of aviation security rescue and fire fighting at the airport, said in a statement on Thursday. The airport operator was also in communication with other institutions to secure the air so it would be clean and clear for planes, Tommy added. “We will monitor the parking spaces before planes arrive and take off and intensify our monitoring of the loading and unloading of cargo,” he said.
City The Tangerang administration has ordered district heads, subdistrict heads and community and neighborhood unit heads to intensify their monitoring following the arrest of three men suspected of being members of a terrorist group in Tangerang, Banten, on Wednesday. The acting mayor of Tangerang, M. Yusuf, said residents should report suspicious figures to law enforcement officials. He added the administration would launch “Operasi Yustisi” to control the in-flow of newcomers into the city. “We want to limit the movements of terrorists who may be newcomers in the area,” Yusuf said on Thursday, as reported by tempo.co. Tangerang administration spokesman Felix Mulyawan said the residents should be involved in the effort to prevent the dissemination of radical teachings in local neighborhoods. “At the least, residents could be more aware of their surroundings and follow the mandatory reporting for newcomers,” Felix said. The National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad conducted raids on Wednesday on locations on Jl. Gempol and Jl. Kunciran Indah in Pinang, Tangerang, which are located 1 kilometer apart. They arrested three men identified as MC, G and A, on suspicions they were part of a terrorist group and also detained a woman as a witness. National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Waseso alleged the group was part of the Jakarta network of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local affiliate of the Islamic State (IS) group. (cal)
City Muhammad Choir, 32, the man the National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad arrested on Wednesday for his alleged involvement in a terror group, always looked neat and relaxed in public, a neighbor has said. The neighbor, who identified herself only as Vera, said that Muhammad often took a morning walk around their neighborhood on Jl. Gempol Raya, Tangerang, wearing a T-shirt and shorts. It was only on Friday that Muhammad, who had a thin beard, wore a loose tunic or gamis. According to the tempo.co report, Vera said she knew Muhammad as a tailor who made school uniforms, sports attire and Islamic dress. “He received a lot of orders, especially for early childhood school [PAUD] uniforms. His customers were mostly women,” Vera said on Wednesday as quoted by tempo.co. Another neighbor, Midah, 43, said Muhammad was a nice neighbor that he called “Om Choir”, or "Uncle Choir". “When he went back to his hometown in Medan, he bought me coffee as a gift. When he went to Sukabumi, Om Choir brought me mochi,” she said. Sukabumi is the hometown of Choir’s wife, whom he married three months ago. Choir lived in a rental house for about a year, paying annual rent of about Rp 10 million (US$710.64). Midah said Choir’s house was full of sewing machines. Choir only had one employee, identified only as G, who was nicknamed Ujang and also arrested on Wednesday. “I don’t know their real names. I called them Om Choir, Ujang and Teteh (a common Sundanese title meaning "elder sister") for [Choir’s] wife,” said Midah. On Wednesday, Densus 88 personnel raided several locations on Jl. Gempol in Pinang and on Jl. Kunciran Indah, which is located about 1 kilometer from Jl. Gempol. They arrested Muhammad, G and another man identified as A who were allegedly involved in a terrorist group. Muhammad’s wife was also detained as a witness. National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Waseso said they suspected the group was part of the Jakarta branch of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS). (cal/ebf)
City PT Transjakarta bus operator and state-owned airport operator Angkasa Pura II (AP II) will provide passengers with free takjil (light snacks) to break the fast during Ramadhan, which starts on Thursday. Transjakarta spokesman Wibowo said the company had prepared 500,000 bottles of sweet tea that would be distributed to Transjakarta stations across the city during Ramadhan. “Free drinks will be distributed on weekdays, starting at 5:30 p.m. until 6.30 p.m.” Wibowo said on Thursday. Besides preparing free drinks, Transjakarta will hold “Music on Shelter” events to entertain passengers at Karet bus station at 4.30 p.m. on Thursday.

We hope passengers and residents living nearby the airport can feel the Ramadhan spirit at the airport,” Erwin Revianto, senior branch manager of communications and legal at Soekarno-Hatta Airport, said in a statement on Wednesday.
City Bekasi Police in West Java have banned “sahur [predawn meal] on the road” convoys and group activities due to security concerns during the fasting month. "We highly recommend that you do not conduct sahur on the road. Just don't. If it is aimed at waking up people, there are many other ways [to do it]," Bekasi Police chief Sr. Comr. Indarto said on Thursday as quoted by kompas.com. Indarto argued that based on past incidents, these activities often lead to brawls and other disturbances in which teenagers throw fireworks at each other. "There is a potential for conflict, so it would be best not to conduct sahur on the road and just have your sahur at home," he said, adding that activities to wake up residents for sahur at kampungs were still allowed. Thursday marked the first day of Muslims fasting for Ramadhan. (fac)
City The Jakarta administration has ruled out compulsory vaccination for kindergarten and elementary school admission, according to a circular letter issued by the Jakarta Education Agency. Jakarta Education Agency deputy head Bowo Irianto said the decision was taken to make it easy for parents who wanted to enroll their children in kindergartens or elementary schools. “Jakarta has a very varied population, so access to schools must be open wide and in a nondiscriminatory way,” Bowo told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. “Besides, immunizations can be done after the children are enrolled in school, which the city’s health facilities will provide,” Bowo said. The circular letter came to attention when a citizen, Widhi Maulana, 32, posted a WhatsApp comment criticizing the decision. “The previous regulation was good to ensure that children are vaccinated, but the administration has changed,” he said in his status. He said that he noticed the circular letter when it was posted at the Penggilingan 1 community health center (Puskesmas) in East Jakartawhile he was trying to get an immunization certificate for his 2-year-old child. He said that even after seeing the letter he still decided to get the immunization certificate. “Perhaps next year they will change the rule again,” he told the Post. Opposition to vaccination among parents has begun to rise, they refuse to vaccinate their children despite the rise in outbreaks of preventable diseases such as diphtheria. (ami)

City The North Jakarta Immigration Office raided on Tuesday an apartment building where 61 foreign nationals reside in Kelapa Gading, North Jakarta, detaining 24 of the expatriates for further investigation. The immigration office's head of supervision, Adi Tri Nugroho, said there were indications that the 24 foreigners violated immigration laws and caused trouble to residents of the apartment building. “Three foreigners were found with illicit substances suspected to be narcotics and they are currently being investigated by the relevant agencies,” Adi said on Tuesday as reported by kompas.com. Adi said the office had also received several complaints from residents who claimed the expatriates harassed them by forcefully grabbing their cell phones and making missed calls, thereby obtaining local residents' phone numbers. Of the 24 expatriates, 20 are Nigerian, one is Gambian, one is Ugandan, one is Senegalese and one is stateless. Some of them could not show their travel documents while others had overstayed their residence permits, Adi said. The foreign nationals were suspected to have been involved in cybercrime, he said. The office had confiscated their laptops and cell phones. Adi said the expatriates would be immediately deported to their home countries. They chose to reside in the Kelapa Gading apartment complex because of its relatively cheap rent, North Jakarta Immigration Office spokesperson Primadita said, adding that they mostly worked in the cloth-trading business.

City The Jakarta Administration plans to hold mass iftar (breaking of the fast) events starting in June, in 223 community units (RW), funded and organized by the administration and private citizens. “Both the administration and citizens will work together for the iftar events, as well as for the funding,” Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said on Tuesday as reported by Warta Kota. Anies said that NGO Dompet Dhuafa and the Aksi Cepat Tanggap (ACT) foundation would receive any donations from citizens who wanted to participate in the iftar events. “For citizens who want to participate in preparing the iftar events, ACT and Dompet Dhuafa will be the channel for them.

The administration will also provide some of the funding,” Anies said. ACT vice president Imam Akbari said that Ramadhan was a time to help those in need. “We want citizens to help each other, so we will facilitate anyone who wants to collaborate with us during the Ramadhan fasting month. We will start with iftar events, which some may regard as trivial, but it is actually precious for some of our friends,” he said. Imam said that ACT also accepted food donations, whether raw or cooked, or volunteers who wanted to help preparing the iftar meals. (ami)
World Multiple people were killed on Friday in a shooting at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, CNN reported, in the latest gun violence in a country still shaken by the massacre at a Florida high school in February. Citing unnamed sources, CNN said there were multiple fatalities after the shooting at the school about 48 kilometers southeast of Houston. The sheriff's office for nearby Harris County said its deputies were assisting with a "multiple-casualty incident." "This is no longer an active shooting situation and the injured are being treated," the sheriff's department said on Twitter. The school district in Santa Fe, said the situation was "active, but has been contained." Local media reported that a suspect was in custody. US President Donald Trump wrote of the shooting on Twitter: "Early reports not looking good. God bless all!" The latest such incident at a US school underscored a national debate over gun control and gun rights that has intensified after an assailant killed 17 students and staff on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
World Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi called for the enforcement of international law in her speech at the UN Security Council (UNSC) open debate in New York on Thursday local time. “The law protects the weak and, more importantly, prevents ‘the mighty takes all’ approach,” she said at the UN headquarters. Speaking in front of 15 UNSC member states, Retno said it was important to uphold and implement international laws and resolutions. “Take resolutions on Palestine, for example. Many security council resolutions on Palestine have not been implemented,” the minister said. The open debate was attended by 12 ministerial officials and representatives from 74 UN member countries. It was held under the rotating presidency of the UNSC, which is currently chaired by Poland. Retno held a bilateral meeting with Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevičius on the sidelines of the event. She also met with Finnish Representative to the UN Kai Sauer to discuss bilateral preparations in co-hosting the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation meeting in Helsinki this June. Retno is scheduled to travel to Georgetown, Guyana, for a bilateral meeting with Guyanese Foreign Minister Carl B. Greenidge and pay a courtesy visit to Guyana President David A. Granger. She will also meet with Caribbean Community (CARICOM) secretary-general Irwin LaRocque. From Guyana, Retno will head to Buenos Aires, Argentina, for G20 and MIKTA Foreign Ministers meetings. She is also scheduled to visit Lima, Peru, for a bilateral meeting with Peruvian Foreign Minister Víctor Ricardo Luna Mendoza. (ebf)
World Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has made a rare decision to open the Rafah crossing with Gaza for a month, allowing Palestinians to cross during the holy period of Ramadan. The decision to keep the crossing open was taken "to alleviate the suffering" of residents in the Palestinian enclave, Sisi said on Facebook late Thursday. The Rafah crossing is Gaza's only gateway to the outside world not controlled by Israel, but Egypt has largely sealed it in recent years, citing security threats. The last extended opening lasted three weeks in 2013, while usually Palestinians are able to cross for a few dozen days a year. Previous openings of Rafah have been cut short by violence in the Sinai peninsula or with authorities giving other reasons. Sisi's announcement comes after some 60 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Gaza's frontier earlier this week, with the victims described by Egypt's foreign ministry as "martyrs". A total of 114 Gazans have been killed in border protests and clashes since March 30, in the run-up to the controversial opening Monday of the US embassy in Jerusalem. Egypt has relations with both Israel and Gaza rulers Hamas, giving Cairo an instrumental role in easing tensions between the two sides and alleviating the pressure on the territory's two million residents. Hamas leader Ismail Haniya paid a brief visit on Sunday to Egypt, where he met with the director of the country's intelligence services Abbas Kamel. For more than a decade Israel has imposed a crippling blockage on Gaza which it says is necessary to isolate Hamas, with which it has fought three wars since 2008. But critics argue it amounts to collective punishment of the enclave's residents, with 47 percent suffering from food insecurity according to United Nations figures. An emergency summit of the world's main pan-Islamic body, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, will be held in Istanbul on Friday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed the extraordinary meeting should send a "strong message to the world" over Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. At an Israeli checkpoint early Friday, Palestinians were crossing from the West Bank town of Bethlehem to the first weekly prayers of Ramadan at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound. Palestinians were seen being searched with metal detectors and having their bags checked by Israeli authorities, while at least two men in wheelchairs were pushed through the checkpoint by border agents.
World Dog meat farmers staged a protest near the National Assembly on Wednesday, calling for equal treatment as other animal farms and demanding survival rights. Some 200 members of Korea Dog Farm Council members took to the streets in front of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea headquarters in Yeouido, Seoul, and demanded the lawmakers introduce a grace period for dog farms to install excreta treatment facilities. In February, the National Assembly passed a revision to the Act on the Management and Use of Livestock Excreta, mandating animal farms operating without permits to install excreta treatment facilities. While all farms were given a grace period of six months, dog meat farms were subjected to the law immediately when it went into effect in March. At the rally, the meat farmers also brought five dogs in cages, as they intended to show the differences between “pet dogs” and “dogs for meat.” They also strongly denounced Rep. Han Jeoung-ae of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, who is the head of the parliamentary environment and labor committee that reviewed the livestock bill. Animal rights activists were also present at the scene, and they clashed with the farmers as they sought to rescue the five caged dogs. Two farmers were arrested at the scene. One was caught after throwing filth toward the animal rights activists, while another was arrested for throwing the police line. The police said it dispatched 400 officers around the protest. 
World An explosive eruption rocked Hawaii's Kilaueau volcano on Thursday sending an ash plume thousands of feet into the air, according to tweets from the U.S. Geological Survey. The powerful, steam-driven blast was expected to spew large amounts of volcanic ash and smoke from Kilauea's crater on Hawaii's Big Island. The eruption has destroyed 37 homes and other structures in a small southeast area of the island and forced around 2,000 people to evacuate their homes.
World More than 100 people were detained Thursday across Brazil in what authorities said was the country's biggest ever crackdown on internet child pornography. Some 2,600 police officers deployed across 24 of Brazil's 26 states and the capital to serve 578 arrest and search warrants related to online sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. So far 132 people had been taken in, including teachers and public sector workers ranging from 20 years old to retirement age, the authorities told journalists in Brasilia. A million pieces of pedophile content were uncovered, officials said. The operation, led by the newly formed public security ministry, "is without doubt the biggest of this kind in the country," said General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz. Security Minister Raul Jungmann said it was even "the biggest in the world to be carried out in a single day." A first phase of the operation, dubbed "Childhood's Light," took place in October 2017, in partnership with US authorities, and led to 112 arrests.
World The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has spread to a city, the World Health Organization said Thursday, raising concern the deadly virus may prove tougher to contain. "One new case of Ebola virus disease has been confirmed in Wangata, one of the three health zones of Mbandaka, a city of nearly 1.2 million people in Equateur Province in northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo," the UN's health agency said in a statement. The outbreak, publicly declared on May 8, had previously been reported in a rural area of Equateur that lies roughly 150 kilometres (93 miles) from Mbandaka. "This is a concerning development," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the statement. The agency said it was deploying around 30 experts to Mbandaka "to conduct surveillance in the city." Forty-four cases have been reported in the outbreak so far, including three confirmed, 20 probable and 21 suspected, according to the WHO's tally.
World More than two dozen writers, poets and artists on Wednesday called for the release of Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize-winner Liu Xiaobo, who has been under house arrest in China since her husband died in custody last year. Concern is growing among Western diplomats and friends of Liu Xia over delayed talks to arrange for Liu to leave China for another country, a wish she has repeatedly made clear. Figures such as Nobel laureate J.M. Coetzee, poet Rita Dove and novelists Paul Auster, Khaled Hosseini and Ma Jian recorded videos of themselves reading excerpts from Liu Xia's poems in a campaign organised by PEN America and Amnesty International. "Liu Xia's cry for freedom resonates around the world and rebukes the Chinese government's hollow claim that she is free," Suzanne Nossel, chief executive of PEN America, said in a statement. China’s foreign ministry, asked to comment, said Liu was a Chinese citizen and her rights were being protected according to the law. The public security ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Liu, an artist and poet who suffers from depression, has been under effective house arrest since her husband, who was jailed by Chinese authorities in 2009 for inciting subversion, won the Nobel prize in 2010. China has said Liu Xia is free, but Western diplomats say she is closely guarded at her home and can only speak with friends and family through arranged visits and phone calls. Western diplomats in Beijing last Friday took the rare step of attempting to visit Liu Xia in her home but were turned away by security personnel, an official of one of the embassies involved told Reuters, but declined to be named. China's government has repeatedly said Liu Xia has all the freedoms granted to her as a Chinese citizen under the law, and her case is an internal affair. The PEN campaign adds to the chorus of calls from Western governments, rights groups, and friends and supporters demanding "true freedom" for Liu Xia. In early May, Liao Yiwu, a writer and friend of Liu's who lives in Germany, said she had told him by telephone that she was prepared to die in China. He also released a recording of Liu crying uncontrollably during another phone call.
World Veteran covert operative Gina Haspel was approved Wednesday to become director of the Central Intelligence Agency in a crucial Senate panel vote, despite her record of involvement in torture in the early 2000s. The Intelligence Committee voted 10-5 to forward her nomination to lead the US spy agency to the entire Senate, virtually assuring final approval of her nomination. "Gina Haspel is the most qualified person the president could choose to lead the CIA and the most prepared nominee in the 70 year history of the agency," said committee chairman Richard Burr. "She has acted morally, ethically, and legally, over a distinguished 30-year career and is the right person to lead the agency into an uncertain and challenging future."
World The Islamic holy month of Ramadan will begin Thursday in Saudi Arabia, the land of the religion's two holiest sites, authorities said. "The first day of the holy fasting month of Ramadan falls on Thursday corresponding to May 17, 2018," the Royal Court said in a statement published by state news agency SPA. The start date is set by both lunar calculations and physical sightings which determine when the last day of one lunar month ends and a new one begins. Traditionally, many Muslim-majority countries have followed the dates set by Saudi religious authorities, but in recent years many have used their own astronomical calculations. Ramadan is a holy month for the world's nearly 1.5 billion Muslims, many of whom practise the ritual of dawn-to-dusk fasting and prayers. Tradition holds that it was during Ramadan that the Prophet Mohammed started receiving revelations of the Muslim holy book, the Koran. Ramadan is one of the five "pillars" of Islam.  The others are the profession of faith ("there is no God but God and Mohammed is his messenger"), the obligation to pray five times a day, charity, and the pilgrimage to Mecca.
World As a new moon marks the start of the holy month of Ramadhan, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo conveyed a message to Muslims in the US and around the world. “On behalf of the US Department of State, I offer best wishes to Muslims around the world for a peaceful and blessed Ramadhan,” Pompeo said in a statement released by the US Embassy in Jakarta on Wednesday. For those observing this month, Pompeo said, Ramadhan was a time of reverence, generosity and spiritual introspection. “Ramadhan is also a cherished time of community, often spent reconnecting with family and friends. It calls Muslims to come together to give charitably to the less fortunate,” he said. Muslims in the US and around the world made valuable contributions to their societies every day, and millions would honor this month in a special way with acts of service and giving back to their neighbors, Pompeo said. In recognition of this, every year, US embassies and consulates around the world hosted Ramadhan activities that brought together Muslims and people of other faiths who were committed to the shared goal of fostering peace, stability and prosperity, he said. These conversations and collaborations were the core strengths of US diplomacy, paving the way for stronger communities through partnerships and respect for diversity, said Pompeo. “As the holy month begins, I wish all those celebrating a very happy and prosperous Ramadhan Kareem.” (ebf)
World Known for unveiling the latest sneakers from Adidas and Nike on his YouTube channel, American vlogger Jacques Slade has unboxed a pair of trainers with a twist - they highlight modern slavery. The price tag - US$90 - reflects the cost of a slave today, the '40M' logo refers to the estimated 40 million people trapped in slavery and the insoles feature pictures of sweatshops where forced labor is considered to be rife globally. The campaign by the Thomson Reuters Foundation - "Unboxing the real price of sneakers" - aims to raise awareness of the hidden human cost of clothing among millennials as the issue of ethical fashion increasingly influences how young people shop. The advent of fast fashion, with consumers constantly buying and discarding clothing, has fuelled the risk of worker abuses such as forced labour in global supply chains, campaigners say. "Being a part of this campaign has made me take a more thoughtful stance on the issues around forced labour," said Slade, who has about 850,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel. "Given the impact we can all make with our voices, I am proud I may be able to help educate and empower those around me to look deeper at their own understanding of the topic and ... inspire them to enact change both locally and globally." Slade's video reveals that the trendy white trainers - created together with a prominent Los Angeles designer - are slavery-free, while pointing to issues in global supply chains. From cosmetics and clothes to shrimp and smartphones, supply chains are often complex with multiple layers across various countries - whether in sourcing the raw materials or creating the final product - making it hard to identify exploitation. In recent years modern slavery has increasingly come under the global spotlight, putting ever greater regulatory and consumer pressure on firms to ensure their supply chains are free of forced labour, child labour and other forms of slavery. "Conscious consumers will be an essential part of the movement that will make companies and governments get serious about ending the evil that taints the products we use every day," said Jakub Sobik of charity Anti-Slavery International. "It's fantastic to see someone like Jacques Slade - who unpacks the products for thousands of young people every day - raise the question of the human price of the things we buy," the UK-based group's spokesman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
World Thirty-four Chilean bishops summoned to the Vatican over a cover-up of sexual abuse by clergy began crisis meetings with Pope Francis on Tuesday that could result in a purge of Chile's Catholic hierarchy. "We feel pain and shame," Fernando Ramos, an auxiliary bishop of Santiago, told a news conference ahead of the three days of closed-door meetings. The scandal has devastated the credibility of the Church in the once staunchly Catholic country. It has also hurt the pope's own image because this year he strongly defended a bishop accused in the alleged cover-up before reversing his position. Bishop Juan Ignacio Gonzalez of the city of San Bernardo said he could not rule out some of the tainted bishops resigning or being sacked, as many Chileans have demanded. "It does not depend on us. Each person must decide this together with the pope," he said. One of the key bishops in the crisis is Juan Barros, whom the pope appointed to the southern city of Osorno in 2015 despite allegations that he had covered up sexual abuse of minors by his mentor, Father Fernando Karadima. Barros has said he was unaware of any wrongdoing. Luis Badilla, a Rome-based Chilean commentator for the Vatican-affiliated blog "Il Sismografo", called for "exemplary and educational decisions" by the pope to put the Chilean Church back on course. During his trip to Chile in January, the pope said he had no proof against Barros, believed he was innocent, and that accusations against him were "slander" until proven otherwise. But days after returning to Rome, the pope, citing new information, sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims, witnesses and other Church members. He produced a 2,300-page report that will be discussed at the Vatican meetings. Victims have also accused other bishops of either covering up the abuse by Karadima, of delaying investigations, or of discrediting victims in the media and demonizing them in private conversations and emails. Last month, Francis held four days of meetings with Juan Carlos Cruz, James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo, three men abused by Karadima when they were teenagers in Santiago. They said in a statement afterwards that they had been "treated as enemies" by Chilean Church leaders for 10 years. Karadima, who trained some of the bishops for the priesthood decades ago, was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing boys in Santiago in the 1970s and 1980s. He never faced civilian justice because of the statute of limitations. Now 87 and living in a nursing home in Chile, Karadima has always denied the allegations. At the pre-meeting news conference, Gonzalez said he had met many victims and knew the three who met the pope last month. One of the victims, Cruz, later tweeted: "I've never seen him before in my life. The truth according to the bishops of Chile is very different from what we all have lived." In a stern statement last Saturday, the Vatican indicated that the pope intended to be tough. It spoke of "cover-ups and grave omissions regarding the victims" and said the meetings would seek to determine "collective and individual responsibility for these devastating wounds". In a homily at his daily morning Mass on Tuesday, without specifically mentioning Chile, Francis said every bishop should know "when it’s time to take his leave and step down". 
World Donald Trump asked Bill Gates to explain the difference between HIV and HPV and expressed “scary” awareness of the Microsoft Corp. co-founder’s 22-year-old daughter when the two men met after the 2016 election, Gates said at a recent meeting with employees of his foundation. The billionaire philanthropist’s account of his meetings with the president became public late Thursday after MSNBC aired a video of him speaking on stage at what host Chris Hayes said was a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation staff meeting earlier this week. In it, Gates recalled to audience laughter the two meetings he’s had with Trump, one in December 2016 at Trump Tower and the other in March 2017 at the White House. “In both of those two meetings he asked me if vaccines weren’t a bad thing because he was considering a commission to look into ill-effects of vaccines,” Gates recalled, noting that Robert Kennedy Jr. had been urging Trump to launch such an effort. Gates said he told Trump, “that’s a dead end, that would be a bad thing, don’t do that.” Trump also asked in both meetings “if there was a difference between HIV and HPV so I was able to explain that those are rarely confused with each other.” Human immunodeficiency virus causes AIDS, while human papillomavirus can cause ovarian and other cancers or genital warts. Vaccines are effective against some strains of HPV but not HIV. The White House and the Gates Foundation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Gates said he was also alarmed by Trump’s awareness of his daughter Jennifer, a top equestrian who met Trump at a Florida horse show. “When I first talked to him it was actually kind of scary how much he knew about my daughter’s appearance. But Melinda didn’t like that too well,” he said. Throughout the video, Gates appeared amused by Trump, noting that the president referred to himself in the third person and left the horse show only to return by helicopter to make a “grand entrance.” The two men had never met before Trump was elected and, Gates joked, even during the 2016 campaign, “he and I were at the same place and I avoided him.”
World Facebook pulled or slapped warnings on nearly 30 million posts containing sexual or violent images, terrorist propaganda or hate speech in the first three months of 2018, the social media giant said Tuesday. In an unprecedented report responding to calls for transparency after the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, Facebook detailed its actions against such content in line with its "community standards". Facebook said improved technology using artificial intelligence had helped it act on 3.4 million posts containing graphic violence, nearly three times more than it had in the last quarter of 2017. In 85.6 percent of the cases, Facebook detected the images before being alerted to them by users, said the report, issued the day after the company said "around 200" apps had been suspended on its platform as part of an investigation into misuse of private user data. The figure represents between 0.22 and 0.27 percent of the total content viewed by Facebook's more than two billion users from January through March. "In other words, of every 10,000 content views, an estimate of 22 to 27 contained graphic violence," the report said. Responses to rule violations include removing content, adding warnings to content that may be disturbing to some users while not violating Facebook standards; and notifying law enforcement in case of a "specific, imminent and credible threat to human life". Improved IT also helped Facebook take action against 1.9 million posts containing terrorist propaganda, a 73 percent increase. Nearly all were dealt with before any alert was raised, the company said. It attributed the increase to the enhanced use of photo detection technology. Hate speech is harder to police using automated methods, however, as racist or homophobic hate speech is often quoted on posts by their targets or activists. "It may take a human to understand and accurately interpret nuances like... selfreferential comments or sarcasm," the report said, noting that Facebook aims to "protect and respect both expression and personal safety". Facebook took action against 2.5 million pieces of hate speech content during the period, a 56 increase over October-December. But only 38 percent had been detected through Facebook's efforts -- the rest flagged up by users. The posts that keep the Facebook reviewers the busiest are those showing adult nudity or sexual activity -- quite apart from child pornography, which is not covered by the report. Some 21 million such posts were handled in the period, a similar number to October-December 2017. That was less than 0.1 percent of viewed content -- which includes text, images, videos, links, live videos or comments on posts -- Facebook said, adding it had dealt with nearly 96 percent of the cases before being alerted to them. Facebook has come under fire for showing too much zeal on this front, such as removing images of artwork tolerated under its own rules. In March, Facebook apologized for temporarily removing an advert featuring French artist Eugene Delacroix's famous work "Liberty Leading the People" because it depicts a bare-breasted woman.
World A Cuban state airways plane with 110 passengers and crew on board crashed shortly after taking off from Havana Friday, leaving a mass of twisted and smoldering fuselage, as the country's president warned many people were feared dead. Cuban state media reported that three people had been pulled alive from the mangled wreckage and were in critical condition in hospital.  There was no other official mention of survivors from a nearly 40-year-old Boeing 737 operated by Cubana de Aviacion, which crashed into a field close to a wooded area near Havana's Jose Marti airport, sending a thick column of acrid smoke into the air. The 110 aboard included six Mexican crew, said Aerolineas Damojh, the Mexican-based company that leased the plane to the Cuban carrier. The plane -- carrying 104 passengers -- was almost completely destroyed in the crash and subsequent fire, which was put out by firefighters who raced to the scene along with a fleet of ambulances. Emergency personnel combed through the wreckage, lending little hope that there could be other survivors. "Three passengers managed to survive the accident. They are in a critical condition. They are already in hospital," the state newspaper Granma said. What appeared to be one of the wings of the plane was wedged among scorched tree trunks, but the main fuselage was almost entirely destroyed. Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who went to visit the scene, told AFP there was a large number of casualties. "There has been an unfortunate aviation accident. The news is not very promising -- it seems that there is a high number of victims," Diaz-Canel said. The president said nine crew members were believed to have been on board, but he was unsure if they had been included in the total of 104 passengers. The 58-year-old president, who succeeded Raul Castro as the island's leader only last month, appeared aghast as he surveyed the recovery efforts, wearing a short-sleeved green shirt and surrounded by officials. In a statement later, the president said an investigation into the cause of the accident was underway. "The bodies are being identified. The ministry of transport has set up a commission to investigate the facts. We will gather all the relevant information and we will communicate that to the people as soon as we will get it," he said. Mexico's government said the plane was built in 1979 and said it had a crew of five Mexicans -- the pilot, co-pilot, and three flight attendants.  However, in a later statement, Aerolineas Damojh said a maintenance technician was also on board. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, is a charter company formed in 1990 that had a fleet of three planes. Mexico's ministry of communications and transportation said the plane had passed inspections in November last year. Airport sources said the plane took off at 12:08 pm (1608 GMT) heading for the eastern city of Holguin, 670 kilometers (about 415 miles) away. From the supermarket where he works near the airport, Jose Luis, 49, said he could see the plane taking off before it banked and plunged to the ground. "I saw it taking off. All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed," he said. Images from Cuban television showed rescue workers at the scene removing what appeared to be a survivor on a stretcher as rain began to fall. Prior to Friday's crash, Cuba's most recent air accident occurred in April, 2017. Eight military personnel died when a Russian-made AN-26 transport aircraft went down in western Cuba. The country's last major airline disaster was in November 2010 when a Cuban Aerocaribbean airliner crashed while on a flight from Santiago de Cuba to Havana, killing all 68 people on board, including 28 foreigners. In July 1997, an Antonov-24 passenger plane crashed into the sea off Santiago de Cuba. All 44 aboard were killed, including two Brazilians and two Spaniards. In March 2002, a small Antonov-2 plane travelling from Cienfuegos to Cayo Coco crashed in the central province of Santa Clara. All 16 people aboard, among them six Canadian tourists, four Britons and two Germans, were killed.
World China has for the first time landed several bombers on an island in the disputed South China Sea, a move that could provoke renewed tensions between countries bordering the strategically vital maritime region. Several bombers of various types -- including the long-range, nuclear strike capable H-6K -- carried out landing and take off drills at an unidentified island airfield after carrying out simulated strike training on targets at sea, the Chinese airforce said in a statement Friday. Wang Mingliang, a defense expert cited in the statement, said the takeoff and landing exercises on islands in the South China Sea will help the air force "strengthen its combat capability to deal with martime security threats". The move comes weeks after US network CNBC reported that China had installed anti-ship and air-to-air defences on outposts in the Spratly Islands that are also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines, citing sources close to US intelligence. Washington warned that Beijing would face unspecified "consequences" over its militarisation of the South China Sea, and said it had raised the issue with China. "I believe this is the first time a bomber has landed in the #SouthChinaSea," Bonnieh Glaser, a China expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, tweeted. In an analysis published on its website, CSIS said the location of the runway was believed to be Woody Island, China's largest base in the Paracel Islands, which is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. The South China Sea issue has been brewing for years, with China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam making competing claims in waters with vital global shipping routes and what are believed to be significant oil and natural gas deposits. China has engaged in years of land-reclamation efforts on reefs it controls in the region and built both civilian and military facilities in the contested area. Chinese military facilities include air bases, radar and communications systems, naval facilities and defensive weaponry including landing strips able to accommodate military planes.
World Ten people, mostly students, were killed when a teenage classmate armed with a shotgun and a revolver opened fire in a Texas high school Friday, the latest deadly school shooting to hit the United States. The gunman, arrested on murder charges, was identified as Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a 17-year-old junior at Santa Fe High School. He is being held on capital murder charges, meaning he could face the death penalty. Governor Greg Abbott said 10 people died and another 10 were wounded in "one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools." "Nothing can prepare a parent for the loss of a child," Abbott told reporters in Santa Fe, located about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Houston. Abbott said the gunman apparently carried out the attack with a shotgun and a .38 revolver that were legally owned by his father. The Houston Chronicle said Pagourtzis also threw pipe bombs into a classroom at the start of the school day. But with gun reform a divisive issue in the United States, Abbott focused on the need to better address mental health concerns and to arm schools, rather than call for limits on the proliferation of weapons. At dusk, hundreds of people, including many children, turned out for a candlelight vigil as the community sought to cope with the tragedy. People prayed and sang "Amazing Grace," tears streaming down some faces. There were hugs, and dogs providing emotional support. Abbott said searches were being conducted at two residences and "explosive devices" had been found, including a "CO2 device" and a Molotov cocktail. He said journal entries by the gunman suggested he wanted to commit suicide but "he gave himself up." Abbott said there were no "warning signs" about the suspect, who had no criminal history, although he did post a picture on his Facebook page of a T-shirt with the words "Born to Kill" on it. Law enforcement authorities were questioning two "people of interest," the governor said. One may have "certain information," he said, and the other had some "suspicious reactions." Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said most victims were students. "Officers inside encountered a bloody mess in the school," a law enforcement official told the Houston Chronicle. Area hospitals said two victims were in critical condition. One of the wounded was a police officer, John Barnes, who engaged the gunman and was shot in the elbow, officials said.  The shooting was the latest in what has become an all-too-familiar situation in American schools, where gun violence has become a part of everyday life, part of a broader toll taken by firearms which are responsible for more than 30,000 gun-related deaths annually in the US. "My friend got shot in the art hall," weeping student Dakota Shrader told reporters. "I shouldn't be going through this," Shrader said as her mother comforted her. "It's my school. This is my daily life. I feel scared to even go back." Shrader said fire alarms went off "and everybody just started running outside. "And the next thing you know everybody looks and you hear 'boom, boom, boom' and I just ran as fast as I could to the nearest forest so I could hide and I called my mom." Earlier this year, 17 people were killed at Marjory Douglas Stoneman High School in Parkland, Florida, -- a massacre that prompted survivors to launch a grassroots campaign against gun violence that led to the largest gun reform rallies in nearly two decades. Friday's was the second mass shooting in Texas in six months. Twenty-six people were killed in a Texas church in November 2017 by a 26-year-old Air Force veteran. Abbott, the Texas governor, said he would convene roundtable discussions to look into ways of preventing such mass shootings in the future. President Donald Trump expressed "sadness and heartbreak" over the shooting and ordered US flags to fly at half-staff for the next few days. "This has been going on too long in our country," Trump said, speaking at an event on prison reform at the White House. "We're with you in this tragic hour." Trump, who has previously shied away from gun control and proposed arming teachers, said he was "determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others." The shooting erupted before 8:00 am, as the first classes of the day were starting. "It was pretty quiet for a few seconds, and then we just hear someone shoot a gun, and just a 'pow-pow-pow,'" student Hunter Mead, 14, told AFP. "And everyone just kind of freaked out. You know, everyone has the instinct, 'Just go, get out of here.'" The Santa Fe shooting came three months after the Florida massacre led to mass protests and their call of "Never again!". "We are fighting for you," tweeted David Hogg, a Stoneman Douglas student who has emerged as a leader of the gun control campaign. Another Stoneman Douglas student, Delaney Tarr, added: "We cannot let this continue to be the norm. We cannot." Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton urged lawmakers to take action. "Every day that we fail to act on gun violence, we are failing our children," Clinton said.
World Cuba begins two days of national mourning Saturday for victims of the crash of a state airways plane that killed all but three of its 110 passengers and crew. President Miguel Diaz-Canel said an investigation was under way into Friday's crash of the nearly 40-year-old Boeing 737, leased to the national carrier Cubana de Aviacion by a Mexican company. Three women pulled alive from the mangled wreckage are the only known survivors. The Boeing crashed shortly after taking off from Jose Marti airport, coming down in a field near the airport and sending a thick column of acrid smoke into the air. The mourning period is to last from 6:00 am (1000 GMT) Saturday to midnight on Sunday, the Communist Party leader and former president Raul Castro said. Flags are to be flown at half-mast throughout the country. The plane was on an internal flight from Havana to the eastern city of Holguin. Most of the passengers were Cuban, with five foreigners, including two Argentines, among them. The plane -- carrying 104 passengers -- was almost completely destroyed in the crash and subsequent fire. Firefighters raced to the scene put out the blaze along with a fleet of ambulances to assist any survivors. What appeared to be one of the wings of the plane was wedged among scorched tree trunks, but the main fuselage was almost entirely destroyed. Built in 1979, the plane was leased from a small Mexican company, Global Air, also known as Aerolineas Damoj. Mexico said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to help in the investigation. The six crew members were Mexican nationals. A press conference is scheduled for 1900 GMT. The 58-year-old Diaz-Canel, who succeeded  Castro as the communist island's leader only last month, appeared aghast as he surveyed the recovery efforts, wearing a short-sleeved green shirt and surrounded by officials. Castro sent condolences to families of the victims of the "catastrophic accident," a statement read, as Russian President Vladimir Putin and a string of Latin American leaders also expressed sympathy. The plane took off from Havana at 12:08 pm (1608 GMT) Friday heading for Holguin, 670 kilometers (415 miles) to the east. From the supermarket where he works near the airport, Jose Luis, 49, said he could see the plane taking off before it banked and plunged to the ground. "I saw it taking off. All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed," he said. Yasniel Diaz, a 21-year-old musician, said the pilot appeared to attempt an emergency landing, but crashed instead. "The explosion shook everything," he said. "I started running, I was so afraid." Images from Cuban television showed rescue workers at the scene removing what appeared to be a survivor on a stretcher as rain began to fall. Global Air said the plane was flying with a crew of six Mexicans -- the pilot, co-pilot, three flight attendants and a maintenance technician. In Mexico City, anguished relatives and colleagues of the crew gathered outside the company's offices demanding information -- some of them hugging and crying. "I was friends with the captain, with the co-pilot, with the head flight attendant," said a former Global Air employee, 44-year-old Ana Marlene Covarrubias. "When I heard the news on the phone, I thought it was one of those jokes people play," she told AFP. The Mexican communications and transportation ministry said the plane was built in 1979. Global Air had the necessary permits to lease it, and had passed inspections in November last year, it said. The company, formed in 1990, had a fleet of three planes, all Boeing 737s. Prior to Friday's crash, Cuba's most recent air accident occurred in April 2017, when eight military personnel died when a Russian-made AN-26 transport aircraft went down in western Cuba. The country's last major airline disaster was in November 2010 when a Cuban Aerocaribbean jet crashed on a flight from Santiago de Cuba to Havana, killing all 68 people on board, including 28 foreigners.
World Ten children found living in squalid conditions in a California home were waterboarded, shot at with crossbows and had scalding water poured over them by their mother and her partner, authorities said. The abuse was detailed in a motion filed by prosecutors to increase the bail of the children's mother, 30-year-old Ina Rogers, who was ordered taken into custody and whose bail was set at $495,000. "On a continuous basis the children were getting punched, strangled, bitten, shot with weapons such as crossbows and bb guns, hit with weapons such as sticks and bats, subjected to 'waterboarding' and having scalding water poured on them," according to the motion filed by prosecutors and obtained by AFP Wednesday. "Due to the continuous abuse, the children have varying forms of scars, including broken arms." Rogers and her husband Jonathan Allen, 29, were arrested on March 31 at their home in the town of Fairfield, north of San Francisco, after police responded to a call about a missing 12-year-old child. Prosecutors said officers entered the house and found nine children huddled together on the living room floor. They said the house was in filthy condition, with clothes, garbage and feces scattered everywhere. The children -- aged from four months to 12 years old, according to police -- were taken into custody and it was only during the subsequent probe that the sadistic abuse came to light, authorities said. "During the investigation, the children thoroughly described the incidents of abuse," according to the motion filed by prosecutors. It said that Rogers was aware of the incidents, which date back several years, "and assisted with the abuse herself." Rogers was arrested and initially charged with one count of misdemeanor child abuse. She now faces nine counts of felony child abuse. "I strive and I pride myself on being a good parent," Rogers previously told reporters outside her home, adding she believed her husband's numerous tattoos made him appear "a scary individual" that others are quick to judge. Meanwhile, Allen, who is also in custody, faces seven counts of torture and nine counts of abuse. The case bears similarities to another uncovered in California earlier this year. In that case, 13 siblings were rescued from a home where their parents, Louise and David Turpin, allegedly held them captive and tortured them.
Politics In a first, the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has charged a company with money laundering. The company, PT PR, is owned by former Kebumen regent Mohamad Yahya Fuad, who was named a graft suspect in a case pertaining to alleged corruption surrounding the budget allocation for the regency’s education agency and youth and sports agency. “This is the first money-laundering investigation carried out by the KPK with a corporation as the perpetrator,” KPK deputy chairman Laode Muhammad Syarif said on Friday as quoted by Antara. The company allegedly used the names of five different companies to take part in procurement projects held by the Kebumen administration between 2016 and 2017. The total value of the projects was Rp 51 billion (US$3.6 million). Mohamad allegedly used the money, received by PR from his own administration’s projects, for his personal expenses. (ahw)
Politics The Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI) is facing criminal charges for allegedly breaking campaign regulations after placing an advertisement in a national newspaper. The Election Supervisory Body (Bawaslu) said in a statement on Thursday that the party’s secretary general, Raja Juli Antoni, and his deputy, Chandra Wiguna, violated Article 491 of the 2017 Election Law on campaign violations. “Bawaslu’s findings have been submitted to the National Police,” it said. The party, it said, had placed an advertisement in the Jawa Pos newspaper on April 23. The advertisement called on the public to help choose the running mate for its presidential candidate, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. It also shows the President’s picture and the party’s logo. The party has denied Bawaslu’s allegation, saying that the advertisement did not feature the party’s platforms and did not ask the public to vote for PSI. “As a new party, we feel like we’re being targeted,” Raja Juli said in a statement. The PSI, which is led by political novices, claims to be the party of millennials, a demographic that will make up a large voting bloc in 2019. (ahw)
Politics The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has named South Bengkulu Regent Dirwan Mahmud of Bengkulu province a graft suspect in an alleged bribery case related to several infrastructure projects in the regency. “[He is] suspected of accepting Rp 98 million [US$6,963] as part of a commitment fee in exchange for his direct appointment [in a company] to handle five construction projects for roads and bridges across South Bengkulu regency,” KPK deputy chairwoman Basaria Panjaitan said during a press briefing on Wednesday evening. The commitment fee, she added, amounted to Rp 112.5 million, or 15 percent from the total project value of Rp 750 million. The antigraft body also named Dirwan’s wife Hendrati and an official from the regency’s health agency, Nursilawati, as suspects for allegedly accepting bribes. Meanwhile, businessman Juhari is suspected of giving them the kickbacks. The KPK also suspect that Hendrawati had collected the funds transferred from the businessman through Nursilawati, the alleged intermediary in the case. All four suspects were arrested by KPK investigators during an operation on Tuesday evening, during which Rp 85 million in cash was seized, as well as evidence of a bank transfer amounting to Rp 15 million and documents of a general procurement project. Bengkulu caught the antigraft body’s attention as a province prone to corruption following three graft arrests it made last year, including the arrest Governor Ridwan Mukti and his wife Lily Martiani Maddari for alleged bribery.

Politics President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo has appointed four new expert staff members to his administration through a presidential decree, Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung has confirmed. Two of the four are Adita Irawati, the former corporate communications vice president for state-owned communications firm Telkomsel, and Abdul Ghofar Rozin, the son of Nahdlatul Ulama senior cleric Mohammad Ahmad Sahal Mahfudz. The two others are Siti Ruhaini Dzuhayatin, the former commissioner of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation's Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission, and Ahmad Erani Yustika, the former director general at the Villages, Disadvantaged Regions and Transmigration Ministry . "They have started working and yesterday they coordinated with the state secretary and I because managerial administration [duties] fall under the Cabinet secretary," Pramono said on Tuesday. Adita's task, he added, was to revamp outdated public relations systems at ministries and state institutions by promoting content-making through social media. Abdul was appointed to assist the President during domestic religious events, such as when Jokowi meets with ulema on visits to Islamic boarding schools. Siti, with her background in religious issues and human rights, was assigned to assist Jokowi in international religious issues. Lastly, Ahmad would assist Jokowi in developing economic policies, given his expertise in village funds, Pramono said. With the additional members, Jokowi now has 10 expert staff members.

Politics The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) apprehended a regional head in Bengkulu over his alleged involvement in a graft case during an operation on Tuesday evening. “Four people were arrested in the operation in Bengkulu: a regent, a member of the regent’s family, a government employee and a businessperson. Investigators seized around Rp 100 million [US$7,090] in cash during the arrest,” KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah said on Tuesday. He added that the implicated individuals were arrested in the middle of an alleged illicit transaction regarding a botched infrastructure project. The antigraft body refused to reveal further details regarding the operation, saying investigators were still working on the case in the field. Reports have indicated that the implicated regent is South Bengkulu Regent Dirwan Mahmud. He was reportedly arrested by graft busters along with his wife. Bengkulu has been red-flagged by the antigraft body as a region prone to corruption, as graft busters have conducted at least three operations to arrest graft-implicated state officials in the province. In September, the KPK arrested a judge at the Bengkulu Corruption Court, Dewi Suryana, for allegedly accepting unlawful gifts. Three months prior to the arrest, graft busters apprehended Bengkulu governor Ridwan Mukti and his wife, Lily Martiani Maddari, for alleged bribery – only days after investigators nabbed Bengkulu Prosecutors’ Office official Parlin Purba in a separate bribery case.

Politics The Central Java General Elections Commission (KPUD) has said it would give an opportunity to political parties supporting incumbent Tegal regent candidate Enthus Susmono, who died on Monday evening, to find a replacement for the deceased for the upcoming regency election. Enthus, who was also known as a dalang (puppet master), died of a heart attack at Soesilo Hospital, Tegal, at 7:15 p.m. local time. The regent was running for a second term in this year’s regional election. “Because he died 46 days before the election, his supporting parties have an obligation to look for his replacement,” said KPU Central Java chairman Joko Purnomo as quoted by kompas.com on Monday. Enthus and his candidate pair Umi Azizah were backed by five parties: the National Awakening Party (PKB), Gerindra, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), the National Mandate Party (PAN) and Hanura. As stipulated in the 2016 Regional Elections Law, the parties are required to nominate a new candidate no later than seven days after Enthus’ death. The elections commission later will verify the nominated candidate. If the party cannot find a replacement, the pair’s candidacy will be aborted, Joko went on to say. Tegal regency is one of 171 regions set to participate in the 2018 simultaneous regional elections slated for June 27. (kuk/ebf)
politics Political analyst Maksimus Ramses Lalongkoe has called on President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to quickly issue a regulation in lieu of law (Perppu) on terrorism, following the deadly bombings in Surabaya and Sidoarjo in East Java. “I ask President Jokowi to issue a Perppu to save this nation from the threat of terrorism, especially since the progress of the revision of the 2003 Terrorism Law at the House of Representatives, which started in 2016, has been slow,” he said in a written statement on Tuesday. Legally, a Perppu may only be issued during an emergency situation in which no existing law or regulation is able to provide solutions to the issue. Former president Megawati Soekarnoputri issued a Perppu on terrorism shortly after the 2002 Bali bombings conducted by Islamist group Jamaah Islamiyah (JI), which killed 202 people in the tourist district of Kuta. That Perppu was eventually ratified into the current law on terrorism. “A Perppu is the right move so we don’t have to wait for the deliberations on the bill in the House, which is held up by different political interests,” Ramses said. He added that police forces were unable to effectively prevent terror attacks because of the limitations of the current law on terrorism, adding to the urgency of issuing the Perppu. (ebf)
Politics West Java gubernatorial candidate Sudrajat made a controversial remark related to next year's presidential election during the third round of public debates for the province's governor and deputy governor election on Monday evening. "If we win, we will change the Indonesian president in 2019," Sudrajat said in his closing statement, as quoted by Antara on Monday. After addressing the remarks, his deputy candidate Ahmad Syaikhu immediately showed a T-shirt emblazoned with a message that read "Gubernur 2018 Asyik, 2019 Ganti Presiden" (Asyik for 2018 Governor, 2019 Change President). Asyik is the nickname for the candidate pair. The closing statement sparked strong reactions from supporters from other candidate pairs, hindering other candidate pair Deddy Mizwar and Dedi Mulyadi, who were backed by Golkar and the Democratic Party, from sending their closing statement. The incident prompted the debate committee to quickly move to calm down supporters of each candidate pair. Sudrajat and Ahmad are backed by three parties in the upcoming election, namely the opposing Gerindra Party and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), as well as the National Mandate Party (PAN). The Peaceful and Benign Islam Party (Idaman) led by dangdut singer Rhoma Irama later declared its support for the pair. Sudrajat's controversial remarks were based on the political hashtag recently made famous by PKS politician Mardani Ali Sera, which some considered to be intended to rev up President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo and his archrival Prabowo Subianto, the Gerindra patron, during the 2019 presidential election. The hashtag became the politician's expression of support for Prabowo, even though the PKS had not yet officially announced its endorsement for any presidential candidate. (kuk/ebf)
Politics President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo has demanded that the House of Representatives to immediately conclude the revision of the Terrorism Law, or he would issue a regulation in lieu of law (Perppu) to empower the state apparatus in the war against terror. Jokowi said a new terrorism law should be enacted within the next session, which begins on May 18. The revision to the Terrorism Law has been ongoing for more than two years since it was initiated in February 2016 following the Jan. 14, 2016, terror attack on Jl. Thamrin in Jakarta. "[The law] is an important legal umbrella for security apparatus and the National Police in their efforts to prevent and counter [terrorism]," Jokowi said on Monday. "If [the revision] is still yet to be passed by the end of [the session] in June, I will issue a Perppu," said Jokowi. Under the law, a Perppu may only be issued during an emergency situation. The President's statement comes on the heels of a string of terror attacks in the country. The latest attack occurred on Monday morning, when a bomb exploded at the Surabaya Police headquarters on Jl. Sikatan. The bombing comes only a day after the deadly suicide bombings on three churches in the city, and several hours after a bomb accidentally went off on Sunday evening at a rusunawa (low-cost apartment) in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Politics Relatively secular nationalist parties will win big in the 2019 legislative elections, beating Islamist parties who may not even be able to get enough votes to enter the House of Representatives, according to a recent political survey. The survey, conducted by the Indonesia Survey Circle (LSI) from April 28-May 5, has found that if the election were held today the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) would get  21.7 percent of the vote, followed by the Golkar Party with 15.3 percent and Gerindra with 14.7 percent. The survey interviewed 1,200 people with a 2.9 percent margin of error. PDI-P, Golkar and Gerindra – all of them proclaim to be nationalist parties – are "first division" parties, the LSI said. The National Awakening Party (PKB) and the Democratic Party, which would garner 6.2 percent and 5.8 percent of the vote, respectively, are in the “middle division". Of the five top parties, only the PKB is a Muslim-based party. The two largest Islamist parties – the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and the United Development Party (PPP) – along with another Muslim-based party, the National Mandate Party (PAN), and one nationalist party, the Nasdem Party, would manage to get less than 3 percent of the vote. Parties need to get 4 percent of the vote to enter the House. One reason why the Islamist parties are struggling to get votes is that they do not have strong political figures to boost their standing, LSI researcher Ardian Sopa said. "And so far, they have yet to offer programs that could address the problems of Muslim voters.” The survey finding has shown that Islamist parties remain unpopular despite reports of rising religiosity among middle-class Indonesians, particularly after the heated Jakarta gubernatorial election when Islamist groups led a series of sectarian rallies to oppose the election of a Christian candidate.

Politics National Mandate Party (PAN) leader Zulkifli Hasan met with former Indonesian Military (TNI) chief Gatot Nurmantyo on Tuesday, in another signal of the party’s attempt to break away from the ruling coalition ahead of the 2019 general election. While other political parties in the ruling coalition — the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), the Golkar Party, the NasDem Party, the Hanura Party and the United Development Party (PPP) — have declared their support for Jokowi, PAN has been busy courting the incumbent’s potential challengers. Zulkifli, who is also the People’s Consultative Assembly speaker, initiated Tuesday’s meeting with Gatot, which was held at his office at the House of Representatives. He said he discussed the political situation in the country ahead of the elections. Gatot was an important figure whose opinions were worth consideration, he stressed. “He is fit to be a presidential candidate,” he said. Gatot has officially declared his presidential bid, though no political party has made a commitment to nominate him. Last week, Zulkifli met with former coordinating maritime affairs minister Rizal Ramli, who was fired by Jokowi in a 2016 reshuffle. Rizal has since become the voice of opposition to the government and is now touted as a potential presidential candidate. In April, Zulkifli also attended a Gerindra Party event during which the party officially nominated its leader, Prabowo Subianto, as its presidential candidate. Even though PAN is a member of the ruling coalition and has one of its members in Jokowi’s cabinet, the party has often broken ranks with the pro-government coalition and sided with the opposition. Its chief patron, Amien Rais, is one the most outspoken critics of Jokowi and has been pushing the party to unseat Jokowi in 2019. Coalition leader PDI-P appears uncomfortable with PAN’s political maneuvering. PAN, for instance, was the only member of the ruling coalition not invited by Cabinet Secretary and senior PDI-P politician Pramono Anung to his office on Monday. “Maybe we just forgot [to invite PAN],” Pramono said when asked about the absence of PAN executives from Monday’s meeting. PAN, along with the Democratic Party and National Awakening Party (PKB), has yet to officially announce its presidential candidate. The party, which does not have enough votes to field its own candidate in the presidential election, may join the Jokowi camp, the Prabowo camp or set up a third alliance with the PD and the PKB.

Politics The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has escalated its probe into a graft case related to the alleged procurement of a VIP helicopter between 2015 and 2016, scheduling a questioning of Indonesian Air Force personnel about the project. “Investigators are set to question four personnel today [as witnesses] because they need more information regarding the procurement,” KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah said on Tuesday. He refused to reveal the identity of individuals scheduled for a questioning by the graft busters. KPK investigators were also scheduled on Monday to question four other military personnel as witnesses to gather more evidence and information for the case. However, they skipped the questioning without any explanation. Febri further said KPK investigators, who had been working along the military police in the case, were currently waiting for the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) report on the state losses caused by the suspected graft case before they proceeded to the next step of their investigation. Initial calculations revealed that the graft case had reportedly caused Rp 224 billion (US$15.9 million) in state losses. Five Air Force personnel have been named suspects by the military police in the case, including former the Air Force chief of staff's planning assistant, First Marshal Supriyanto Basuki, for alleged insubordination, misuse of authority and embezzlement. Meanwhile, the antigraft body accused Irfan Kurnia Saleh, the president director of PT Diratama Jaya Mandiri, which procured the chopper, of allegedly rigging the helicopter tender process from manufacturing company Agusta Westland to win the project.

Politics National Mandate Party (PAN) executive Yandri Susanto said his party was supporting Muslim group Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia’s (HTI) plan to file an appeal against the Jakarta Administrative Court’s (PTUN) ruling to reject the group’s lawsuit against its disbandment by the Law and Human Rights Ministry. He said the appeal process was HTI’s effort to seek justice over an arbitrary movement caused by the implementation of Law No.16/2017 on mass organizations. “Any entity, not only HTI, that has been disbanded by the government without a proper legal procedure and that feels that the move has resulted in their losses can file a lawsuit against the disbandment via the court. I think such an arbitrary movement to disband an organization is not right and is unfair,” said Yandri as quoted by kompas.com in Jakarta on Monday. Yandri said PAN last year rejected the ratification of the government regulation in lieu of law (Perppu) on mass organization (Ormas). He said there was a potential for the law to be misused as a tool to arbitrarily disband mass organizations that were not in line with the government.   “We have rejected Perppu Ormas since the very beginning. This is because disbanding a mass organization must be conducted in a proper way, not like what has happened today. The state must first take legal measures against a mass organization before disbanding it,” said Yandri. As previously reported, PTUN Jakarta rejected HTI’s lawsuit against the Law and Human Rights Ministry’s decision to disband the group. The court’s panel of judges said the ministry’s decision was in line with existing procedures. (ebf)
Politics Former Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) chairman Abraham Samad called for the implementation of the death penalty for corruption convicts during a speech in which he declared his intention to run as a presidential candidate, in Makassar, South Sulawesi, on Monday.“Corruptors must be given a severe punishment [...] and their assets must be confiscated by the state. Implement the death penalty for corruptors, if necessary. This can provide legal certainty,” said Abraham. He further said corruption had damaged the country and led to poverty, causing the state to lose its authority. “How can we get out of this slump? The only answer is by combating corruption. Whatever the way is, no matter how scary the risk is, we must fight against corruption,” he said. The Eastern Indonesian People's Coalition declared its support for Abraham Samad to run as a presidential candidate at Losari Beach in Makassar on Monday afternoon.The coalition said Indonesia needed a tough and brave leader with integrity and a strong commitment to combating corruption. Abraham was a figure with all of those leadership qualities, it stated. During his speech, Abraham also said politics must bring the nation to prosperity. Politics that only cared about money must be banished since it would only fool and mislead the people, he said. In 2015, Abraham and former KPK commissioner Bambang Widjajanto, along with KPK investigator Novel Baswedan, were arrested by the police over suspected law violations. Human rights organizations called the police’s move an effort to criminalize the KPK leaders. (hol/ebf)
Politics A former leader of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), Abraham Samad, is gathering support for a run in the 2019 presidential election from a group calling themselves the Eastern Indonesian People’s Coalition. The group declared its support on Losari Beach in Makassar, South Sulawesi, on Monday. Before hundreds of people Samad said he was ready to “dedicate his life” to Indonesia. He said that after he retired from the KPK he had visited the regions and said people trusted him to improve Indonesia. He said he contacted several political parties, although he declined to specify the names. “We haven’t touched on the details. Only to discuss about our shared vision and mission,” he said. Samad said he was open to the possibility of becoming a vice-presidential candidate. He also said he had yet to decide his political leaning. During his speech on Monday, he reiterated how corruption ailed Indonesia and that he was the one who could cure it. In 2015 Samad was embroiled in scandals involving alleged document forgery and intimate pictures of a man looking like him with a woman. The scandals became public shortly after he along with then KPK colleague Bambang Widjojanto named then police chief candidate Gen. Budi Gunawan as a suspect in its investigation into the police general's suspicious bank accounts worth billions of rupiah in 2010. Budi is now the National Intelligence Agency chief. (evi)
Politics President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo welcomed Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang at the Bogor Palace on Monday, a visit that marks the fifth year of Indonesia and China’s strategic comprehensive partnership. Following a lavish welcome ceremony, Jokowi and Li planted a camphor tree as a symbol of good bilateral ties, followed by a tête-à-tête on the Palace veranda. The two leaders then proceeded with bilateral talks, which were expected to focus on the countries' economic partnership, including trade and investment. In a press briefing on Friday, Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said Jokowi aimed to narrow the country's  trade deficit with China through increasing Indonesian exports to China and other measures. China ranks as the third-largest foreign investor in Indonesia with US$3.36 billion in 2017, a significant increase from $2.66 billion in 2016. Between 2015 and 2017, Indonesia reduced its trade deficit with China to 11.63 percent. Retno opened the possibility that Jokowi and Li would discuss several regional issues, including the Korean peace process and maintaining peace in the South China Sea. Monday marked Li's first visit to Indonesia as Prime Minister. He previously visited the country in 2008, when he was deputy prime minister. (dmr)
Politics Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) general commissioner Mardani Ali Sera played a leading role on Sunday at an event aimed at preventing the reelection of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo in next year’s presidential election. The politician made a declaration against the incumbent at an event organized by the #2019GantiPresiden (#2019ChangeThePresident) movement in the Monas area of Jakarta. In his speech, the politician also stated that the movement had not expressed support for any particular 2019 presidential candidate, including Gerindra Party Prabowo chairman Subianto. “We ask all of them, whether Prabowo or Gatot [Nurmantyo] or Yusril [Ihza Mahendra] or Sohibul Iman [...], including Jokowi, to prove that they are fighting for Pancasila. If they do, then we will support them,” he said, as quoted by kompas.com. He was referring to individuals that had shown some interest in running for president. During his anti-Jokowi declaration, Mardani stressed that the #2019GantiPresiden movement had yet to propose any candidate. However, the movement would make an official announcement regarding its political stance in August. (roi)
Politics The Democratic Party is seeking confirmation from the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) about reports that one of its senior members has been arrested on graft allegations. The KPK announced that it had arrested nine people, including one lawmaker, in a raid on Friday evening. The commission declined to identify the lawmaker, only saying that he or she was a member of House of Representatives Commission XI on financial affairs. Media reports, however, quoted a source within the KPK as saying that the lawmaker in question was a Democratic Party politician from West Java. “We’re checking it [the allegation] with the KPK,” the party’s spokesperson, Imelda Sari, said. She said the party would punish any of its members charged with corruption. “If they are proven [guilty], they will have their legislative seat revoked. We hope such an incident won't happen again,” Imelda said. The Democratic Party, led by former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, is the second-largest opposition party after Gerindra. It is now deciding whether to support President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo's reelection bid or challenge the incumbent candidate in 2019. The party garnered the most votes during the 2009 legislative election when Yudhoyono was seeking a second term. The party’s popularity sank in 2014 following a series of graft allegations that plagued its members. (ahw)
Politics The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) arrested nine people, including one lawmaker, in a raid in Jakarta on Friday evening.  “There were nine individuals arrested. They consist of one House of Representatives member overseeing financial affairs, businesspeople and government employees,” KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah said on Saturday. He added that KPK officials confiscated hundreds of millions of rupiah from one of the arrestees during the operation.  Febri, however, refused to reveal further details on the arrests, saying investigators would gather more information and evidence before naming any suspects in the case. Friday’s arrest was the ninth operation carried out by the antigraft body this year. On April 11,  a KPK investigation team arrested West Bandung Regent Abu Bakar, who was suspected of asking for money from a number of regency administration officials to fund the political campaign of his wife, Elin Suharliah, who is now running in the upcoming election for the West Bandung regent seat.

Politics The West Java Police have dropped the investigation into a defamation case involving Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, citing a lack of evidence. “The [West Java Police’s] general crime division unit closed the case as of last month, maybe even in late February,” West Java Police spokesperson Adj. Sr. Comr. Trunoyudo Wisnu Andiko told The Jakarta Post on Friday. Rizieq was accused of insulting the state ideology of Pancasila and the nation’s founding father, Sukarno, when a video of him comparing the early version of Pancasila drafted by Sukarno and the Jakarta Charter’s version went viral on social media. The original version of the Jakarta Charter's Pancasila, which was formulated by the nine founding fathers, including Sukarno, contains a clause obliging Muslims to abide by sharia. In the video, Rizieq says: “In Sukarno’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the butt, but in the Jakarta Charter’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the head. Which one is better? Sukarno’s or the Jakarta Charter’s?” The West Java Police’s chief detective, Sr. Comr. Umar Surya Fana, said they had to drop the case because they only had a clip of the video. “The judges want us to provide the video of the whole sermon, which we do not have,” he said. “We have asked the plaintiff to provide the full video, but they are unable to provide it.” The report against Rizieq was made by Sukmawati Soekarnoputri, the third daughter of Sukarno. The firebrand cleric was charged under articles 154a and 320 of the Criminal Code on insulting the state ideology and defamation. Rizieq’s supporters have accused the government of criminalizing their leader. In a meeting with President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo at the Bogor Palace last month, several Islamist groups, including the FPI, asked Jokowi to stop criminal probes into their leaders. The FPI leader reportedly fled to Saudi Arabia after a steamy conversation allegedly involving him and a woman was uploaded online. The police have charged him with spreading pornography and, as of now, have yet to drop the case. The State Palace has said President Jokowi will not interfere with the law. (ahw)
Sports The Indonesian Badminton Association (PBSI) is against the idea of changing the badminton rules to move from the current best-of-three scoring system with a maximum 21 points (21 x 3) to a best-of-five system with 11 as the maximum points (11 x 5). The proposed new scoring system is one of the issues to be discussed during the Badminton World Federation (BWF) annual general meeting in Bangkok on Saturday, ahead of the Thomas and Uber Cup to be held in the Thai capital from Sunday to May 27. PBSI secretary-general Achmad Budiharto said most of the Asian countries, which are in favor of the current scoring system, would suffer disadvantages should the BWF decide to apply the new scoring system. “Almost 70 percent of the top badminton players come from Asia. Most of the Asian countries are against the idea of changing the current scoring system,” he told The Jakarta Post on Friday. “I believe the badminton spectators also prefer the game with the current scoring system, [as it is more exciting than the discussed new system],” he added. The current scoring system is also profitable for the sponsors, as they will receive more brand awareness with longer times of coverage during the match compared to the best-of-five system, which is believed to reduce the length of the game. Achmad went on to say that the idea of changing the scoring system was part of the efforts of some countries outside of Asia to end the continent’s domination of badminton.
Sports Host Indonesia has been drawn in Group A with giants the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar as well as Chinese Taipei in the AFC Asian Cup Under-19 soccer tournament, which will be held in the country from Oct. 18 to Nov. 4. The draw took place in Jakarta on Friday, reported Antara. The UAE won the cup in 2008, while Qatar won the trophy in 2014. In the meantime, Indonesia nailed the 1961 title, while Chinese Taipei's best finish was third in the 1966 cup. Indonesia's coach Indra Syafri admitted that his young guns would play against tough teams in the group stage. He, however, was confident that the squad would reach the semifinals as expected. “You are looking at Asia’s 16 best [teams in the cup], but nothing is impossible. It is our job to train the boys and lead them to the semifinals." “In the meantime, we also have to strategize if we reach the quarterfinals, where we will face Group B teams [Japan, Iraq, Thailand or North Korea],” he added.
Sports Team China is hoping for a clean sweep of this year's Thomas and Uber cups in Bangkok, sending in men's badminton big guns Chen Long, Shi Yuqui and Lin Dan as their women shuttlers aim for a fourth win on the spin.  The prestigious biennial event, which starts Sunday, brings together 16 top teams from five continents for a week of intense competition for the men's Thomas Cup and the Uber Cup which is contested by the women. China, the world's highest ranked team, arrive with a point to prove on the men's side after ignominiously tumbling out in the quarters on home soil two years ago. Olympic champion Chen Long, is joined by this year's All England champion Shi Yuqui -- and the man he conquered in the final, the evergreen Lin Dan. Flanked by a strong doubles side, China should cruise through a group with France, Australia and an under-strength India, who have left out a number of their stars to keep them fresh for the Asian Games. "China's men are strong this year... everyone will be praying to avoid them," said Rajes Paul a journalist and badminton expert at The Star newspaper in Malaysia. Japan will likely provide the main challenge with "bad boy" Kento Momota -- banned from the Rio Olympics for illegal gambling -- back in their ranks, she added.  Last month Momota stunned the hot favourite Chen Long to be crowned badminton's Asian champion, breezing past Malaysian great Lee Chong Wei in straight sets on his way to the final. Reigning Thomas Cup champions Denmark, who in 2016 made history by becoming the first non-Asian team to take the silver-gilt trophy, have their own ace in the pack - world number one Viktor Axelsen. But they must compete without doubles star Carsten Mogensen, who has been ruled out with sickness. Denmark's group includes Russia, Algeria and Malaysia for whom veteran Lee Chong Wei is making his final Thomas Cup tilt. - Japan main threat - China's bid to retain the Uber Cup has been boosted by the return from long-term injury of former world number one and London 2012 Olympic gold medallist Liu Xuerui. Holders China have relinquished the Uber Cup once in the last 10 tournaments -- in 2010 to South Korea -- and the young team carry high expectations to Bangkok. But Xuerui's return may not be enough to help fend off the expected challenge from five-time winners Japan, who are led in the singles by world number two Akane Yamaguchi, number eight Nozomi Okuhara and who also boost two strong doubles pairs.  "It will be close. Maybe it could be the end of the era of China (dominance)?" Paul added. The home challenge will be spearheaded by Ratchanok Intanon -- the current world number four better known to Thais as Nong May -- and have a solid team that should emerge comfortably from a group including India, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Germany. "We hope the women's team can make into the semi-finals," Grithtin Kridtanukoon, a coach on the Thai team told AFP. The Uber cup final is scheduled for Saturday 26, with the men battling it out the next day. The competition is proceeded by the Badminton World Federation (BWF) annual general meeting where proposals to change the scoring system to shorten games and win new fans will be discussed. Also on the agenda is the question of match fixing. Two Malaysian players were handed career-ending bans and fines by the BWF this month for match-fixing. 
Sports Italian soccer legend Alessandro Del Piero touched down in Medan, North Sumatra, on Thursday for a two-day visit to the city with an agenda ranging from meet-and-greets to a coaching clinic and talent scouting. Del Piero, who visited Jakarta in 2015, praised Indonesia’s strong passion for soccer and said he believed that Indonesian soccer would grow, especially with support from home fans. “I came here to see the potential of Indonesian soccer, especially in North Sumatra, which is I believe the home of great talent,” Del Piero told the press. The selected talent is set to get training before playing professionally in Belgium. The 43-year-old who helped Italy win the 2006 FIFA World Cup said that he knew about Medan and North Sumatra from Radja Nainggolan, a Belgian soccer star who currently plays for Serie A’s Roma. Nainggolan’s father, Marius, hails from North Sumatra. “I believe you have the talent here, just like Radja,” said the former captain of Juventus. Del Piero, also known as Ale, received a warm welcome from Juventus fans in the city. In the Thursday-Friday visit, del Piero is set to participate in a coaching clinic, a talent-scouting session, fun soccer, meet-and-greet as well as a charity event for victims of the Mount Sinabung eruption.
Sports Diego Maradona is coming to Belarus as chairman of a small top-flight club with big European ambitions. The Argentine legend posted a photo on Instagram late Tuesday of what Dinamo Brest said was a three-year contract to serve as chairman of the board. "Thanks for the trust and for thinking of me," Maradona wrote in his post. Dinamo Brest also posted pictures of the 1986 World Cup winner holding up a green and red Belarusian flag while wearing a matching black T-shirt and shorts. Maradona stepped down as coach of United Arab Emirates second division club Al-Fujairah last month after failing to secure their promotion. Dinamo Brest were acquired by new owners three years ago who are intent on breaking the historic dominance of the country's two big sides: Dinamo Minsk and BATE Borisov. The 57-year-old will be in charge of the team's transfer policy and strategic development. "Will Maradona be able to help Belarusian -- particularly Brest -- football? I think the answer is obvious," said club spokeswoman Olga Khizhinkova. She also insisted that the global star intended to spend most of his time in the small city on Belarus's southwest border with Poland. "We are already looking for a place for him to live," Khizhinkova said. "We expect that if not the whole time, he is going to spend a substantial portion of his time in Brest." Dinamo currently sit eight in the 16-team Premier Division. The club were formed in 1960 and spent their first 32 years in the Soviet Union's second and third divisions. Dinamo were automatically promoted to top-flight Belarusian football when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. They finished third in the inaugural Belarusian season but have never qualified for Europe. The team's new owners have told Belarusian media that they intended to acquire new talent and invest significant resources in the club this year. Khizhinkova said Maradona will come to Brest after completing a Russia World Cup assignment for Venezuelan television.
Sports Egyptian soccer star Mohammed Salah set a scoring record this season that helped Liverpool clinch fourth place in the Premier League. Now pictures of his bearded face are boosting sales ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Manufacturers have plastered his image on traditional Ramadhan products ranging from pillows to lanterns "famous" and paper cut-outs as they try to cash in on his success to offset economic hardships caused by the government's financial reforms. "The Mohamed Salah lantern is the highest selling lantern this year," said Essam, a shopkeeper, who did not give his last name. Other shopkeepers at a market in Cairo's Sayeda Zainab neighborhood said "Salah mania" was also helping them sell. Salah scored 44 goals in 51 games in his debut campaign and last week won the Football Writers Association award. Next month, the 25-year-old will lead Egypt's first team for 28 years at the World Cup. "Mohamed Salah is a role model for all Egyptians at the moment," said Omnia, a shopper. "All of Egypt loves Mo' Salah, as they call him in England." Demand for food and traditional items soars during Ramadhan, a month whose start date depends on the sighting of a crescent moon.
Sports Turkey's football chief Tuesday condemned as "slanderous" and "unacceptable" German criticism of a meeting between top players of Turkish origin in Britain's Premier League and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Germany internationals Mesut Ozil of Arsenal and Ilkay Gundogan of Manchester City, both of Turkish origin, met Erdogan late Sunday during his three-day visit to Britain. Pictures of the meeting were then posted on the official Twitter account of Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) ahead of June 24 presidential and parliamentary elections. German Football Federation (DFB) president Reinhard Grindel responded that international players should not let themselves be "manipulated" in Erdogan's election campaign. But Turkish Football Federation (TFF) chairman Yildirim Demiroren hit back by saying he had read Grindel's "slanderous" postings "with great sadness". "The thoughts expressed by the DFB president are absolutely unacceptable," Demiroren said in a TFF statement. He described Erdogan, a footballer in his youth, as a "passionate football fan" and someone who had made a huge contribution to the game in Turkey. "So it's completely normal that he meets three Turkish-origin footballers born in Germany," Demiroren added. "This would be normal in any nation... if a footballer was invited by the president." 'My dear president' As well as Ozil and Gundogan, who were both born in the German city of Gelsenkirchen, also present was striker Cenk Tosun of Everton who was born in the German town of Wetzlar but represents Turkey. All three players handed over souvenir signed club shirts to the president. "To my dear president, with my respects," Gundogan wrote on his. Demiroren said that Grindel had made a "terrible mistake" by allowing politics to infect sport and implied it could be a tactic in the race between Turkey and Germany to host the Euro 2024 tournament. "The Turkish Football Federation will engage in no such behaviour and will continue its bid for Euro 2024 to the end within the rules of UEFA," he said. Gundogan insisted after the controversy he "didn't want to make a political statement with this photo and even less so campaign" in the election. But the images caused a furore in Germany, with lawmaker Cem Ozdemir, himself of Turkish origin, reminding the players that "the president of an international German footballer is called Frank-Walter Steinmeier," referring to the German head of state.
Sports Lewis Hamilton says he is close to signing a new Mercedes contract after winning Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix watched by several members of the all-conquering German constructor's board. In the aftermath of his dominant triumph ahead of team-mate Valtteri Bottas the defending four-time world champion indicated he will soon be inking a long-awaited new deal with the champions. An announcement before or during the Monaco Grand Prix later this month is now expected. “All the bosses have been here and l don't think there is anyone in the hierarchy who has any concerns," said Hamilton. "We do talk about it and we are not far away from finishing things. It will happen - hopefully in the near future." The 33-year-old Englishman was so thrilled by both his own personal return to form and the team’s work on improving his car’s performance at the Circuit de Catalunya that he suggested, after the race, that he may sign a long-term deal. It had been rumored that he was reluctant to sign a new contract because he feared losing enjoyment of the racing and had reservations about the sport's future direction under new American owners Liberty Media. But after securing his 64th career win in majestic fashion in a crushing Mercedes one-two that hoisted both drivers and team clear at the top of their respective championships, he said: “If I keep this feeling then I'm going to be racing for a long time!” Team boss Toto Wolff was also more positive – not only about their performance, but also securing Hamilton for the long-term future. "It’s almost all sorted,” he said. “We don't want to lose him and l don't think he wants to go anywhere else… Everything is going fine. We have had other priorities in the last few weeks. “We weren't happy with the performance of the cars and we needed to sort things out. Finalizing a contract takes time and we both decided to park it." Hamilton, like teammate Bottas, has less than year remaining on his current contract and has been elusive on making any firm commitments to both Mercedes and Formula One at various times in recent months. But his emphatic win on Sunday, when he and Mercedes appeared to have rediscovered the form of past triumphant seasons, may be seen as a major turning point for all concerned. While Ferrari faltered, with four-time former champion Sebastian Vettel finishing fourth and Kimi Raikkonen retiring with power problems, Hamilton did not put a wheel wrong on his way to confidence-boosting victory. "I would like to hope that this race could be part of a turning point," said Hamilton. "I said that I wanted to come here and win the way that I won and when I came across the line I was just happy that I did as I planned. "The team have been working very hard to understand the tires and how the car works so I think it all came together this weekend. "We definitely go to Monaco on a high note, but we know that we still have a lot of work to do. That said, I will sleep like a baby tonight." Hamilton will hope also that Ferrari fail to repeat the form that brought them a one-two finish in the Mediterranean principality last year where Vettel won. On Sunday, the German admitted: "No excuses – they were faster than us and beat us fair and square this time, but we can bounce back." Wolff added that Hamilton’s triumph would repair some of the damage done by his recent loss of form and confidence. "The best ones are very sensitive and fragile and that is something we know and he knows," he explained. "He was solidly in the lead in Melbourne and suddenly he was behind the Ferrari. It is difficult to cope with and in the following races we struggled. "But having such a good weekend here and winning by a solid margin is very important for his confidence."
Sports The US Supreme Court freed states to legalize gambling on individual sporting events, unleashing what will be a race to attract billions of dollars in wagers and heralding a new era for the nation’s sports leagues. The justices on Monday struck down the federal law that had barred single-game gambling in most of the country, saying it unconstitutionally forced states to maintain their prohibitions. Nevada has been the only state with legal single-game wagering. Sports gambling could begin in a matter of weeks in casinos and racetracks in New Jersey, which instigated the legal fight by repealing its gambling ban. Mississippi, Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware and West Virginia could follow soon, and the number of states might reach double digits by the end of the year. Shares of casino operators and their suppliers jumped on the news. Scientific Games Corp., a slot machine maker that also processes bets for sports book operators, rose 9.8 percent, while Caesars Entertainment Corp., the largest US casino operator, rose 6.3 percent. MGM Resorts International, the largest owner of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, rose 6.3 percent. The company gave a presentation to investors last week in which it sketched out a future of more professional sports teams in Las Vegas and a greater presence nationally in sports betting, either online or in casinos. “We believe in the next two years to three years, there are 10 to 12 states that are ripe and ready to activate on that,” MGM President William Hornbuckle said. “We will be there. We will participate in it. We bring technology. We bring knowledge. And frankly in this space, we bring trust.” Some of the biggest gains were seen by non-US betting parlor and online operators that have already been taking wagers on sports in other countries. William Hill Plc, one of the UK’s largest betting-shop operators, rose 5.6 percent. William Hill operates the largest number of sports books in Nevada. Stars Group, a Canadian company that operates the PokerStars brand, saw a 12 percent gain. Americans place US$150 billion a year in illegal sports bets, according to the casino-backed American Gaming Association. The research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming puts the number at $50 billion to $60 billion, not counting bets among friends. Sports leagues fought New Jersey in court even while moving toward embracing legalized wagering. In January, a National Basketball Association executive told New York lawmakers the leagues should get 1 percent of all bets. The NBA says it would prefer a new federal law to set nationwide standards. New Jersey had been trying to legalize sports gambling in its casinos for years, starting with a 2012 law that explicitly authorized wagering. Federal courts struck down that measure as violating the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sport Protection Act, or PASPA. That law says states other than Nevada may not "sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license or authorize by law or compact" a sports-gambling system. New Jersey then took a less direct approach by exempting racetracks and Atlantic City casinos from its gambling prohibition but not explicitly authorizing wagering or setting up a new regulatory system. A Philadelphia-based federal appeals court voted 10-2 to throw out that law as well. The Supreme Court vote was 6-3 to strike down the entire federal prohibition. The majority said PASPA violated the Constitution’s 10th Amendment by "commandeering" the states’ regulatory power. "The provision unequivocally dictates what a state legislature may and may not do," Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented. Justice Stephen Breyer issued a partial dissent, saying he would have effectively left the ban on sports gambling intact by upholding some parts of the statute. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who led the legal fight to legalize gambling, tweeted that "New Jersey citizens wanted sports gambling and the federal Gov’t had no right to tell them no." The New Jersey law was challenged by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and Major League Baseball. The lead case is Murphy v. NCAA, 16-476.
Sports Argentine President Mauricio Macri knows the political power of soccer. When superstar Lionel Messi, 30, announced a tearful retirement from international soccer in 2016, it was Macri who took to national television to beg him to reconsider. Messi returned and led the team to qualify for next month’s World Cup in Russia, lifting the mood of the nation. That must make the dilemma now facing Macri all the harder. The former president of Boca Juniors, Argentina’s most profitable soccer club, must decide whether to stay home and help negotiate a credit line from the International Monetary Fund, or watch the opening games of the World Cup. It is a sign of how bad the economic crisis is that Macri may have little choice. The talks are scheduled to last about six weeks and Argentina’s first game is on June 16 against Iceland in Moscow. No decision has been made, according to local newspapers. But they are reporting that Macri may skip the tournament as he seeks to halt the slump in the currency. Should the runners-up in the 2014 tournament pass the group stage of the World Cup, Macri will want to be in Russia supporting Messi and the rest of the team the second the talks end.
Sports Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was charged by UEFA on Friday over his comments about referee Michael Oliver after the Italian side's dramatic Champions League quarterfinal loss to Real Madrid last month. The 40-year-old has been charged both with breaching UEFA's "general principles of conduct" over his outburst and also for his red card for dissent. European soccer's governing body said the case will be dealt with on May 31. The last-eight clash between holders Real and Juventus was decided by a last-gasp Cristiano Ronaldo penalty after the Serie A champions had staged a remarkable comeback to wipe out a 3-0 first-leg deficit at the Santiago Bernabeu. But Buffon, who was sent off in the aftermath of the penalty decision, lashed out at Oliver's decision to award the spot-kick, saying the English official had a "rubbish bin for a heart". "You have to be a murderer to make the last two decisions the referee made," Juve captain Buffon said. "You cannot ruin the dreams of a team. I could've told the referee anything at that moment, but he had to understand the degree of the disaster he was creating. "If you can't handle the pressure and have the courage to make a decision, then you should just sit in the stands and eat your crisps." The 2006 World Cup-winner is set to retire at the end of the current season, so any potential ban from European soccer may not affect his future. Buffon later defended his comments, saying the drama made him "feel alive". Although the goalkeeper was widely criticised for his comments, referee Oliver and his wife Lucy were both targeted on social media in the days after the game and were offered police support. Buffon has never won the Champions League in his illustrious 23-year career. He could win a fourth straight Serie A and Italian Cup double this weekend as his Juventus side look to clinch the league title when they play Roma on Sunday, having thrashed AC Milan 4-0 in Wednesday's Cup final.
Sports Manchester United confirmed on Wednesday that legendary former manager Alex Ferguson is out of intensive care following emergency surgery for a brain haemorrhage. Ferguson, 76, was admitted to Salford Royal Hospital for the procedure on Saturday after a fall at his home near Manchester. "Sir Alex no longer needs intensive care and will continue rehabilitation as an inpatient," United said in a statement. "His family have been overwhelmed by the level of support and good wishes but continue to request privacy as this will be vital during this next stage of recovery." United's statement was the first update on Ferguson's condition provided by the club since saying the procedure on the haemorrhage on Saturday had gone "very well". Considered the most successful manager in the history of British football, Ferguson won 38 trophies in just over 26 years in charge of United, including 13 Premier League titles and the Champions League twice before retiring in 2013. Earlier on Wednesday, current United manager Jose Mourinho said the club are "very positive" Ferguson would make a full recovery. The esteem with which Ferguson is held around the world was reflected in an outpouring of well wishes, including from a number of United's rivals and figures the Scot challenged for trophies during a glorious career. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp described Ferguson as "absolutely the boss". "All the Manchester City fans in the stadium, you cannot find one person who does not wish the best for an amazing person," said Pep Guardiola, manager of cross-city rivals Manchester City on the day City lifted the Premier League trophy. "The whole football world is incredible but outside of that as well, from all corners of the globe and different walks of life, people have shown their support," United club captain Michael Carrick told MUTV. "That's the effect he had on people. It was the effect he had on everyone. He means a lot to me, as he does to this club."
Sports Amid efforts to use only recycled metals in the medals for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, there is growing concern over a shortage of silver. Half the necessary bronze has been collected in the year since collection began, but nearly twice as much silver is needed. If the situation remains unchanged, organizers likely will face a shortage. With collection scheduled to end one year from now, the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games will accelerate its efforts by newly installing collection points at universities and post offices across the country. Recycled metals were used to produce medals for the 2012 London Games and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, while for the 2020 Tokyo Games, a plan is under way to use only metals recovered from small electronic devices such as old smartphones. It is the first such attempt in Olympic history. Small electronic devices are also called “urban mines.” For example, a laptop computer contains about 0.3 grams of gold, about 0.84 grams of silver and about 81.6 grams of bronze. Japan is said to be one of the world’s leading countries in terms of the amount of precious metals contained in small electronic devices. According to the organizing committee, there will be an equal number of gold, silver and bronze medals for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. A total of at least 5,000 medals are required. Silver and bronze medals are made almost entirely from pure silver and bronze. But under International Olympic Committee rules, a gold medal should be made by using silver as a base material with at least six grams of pure gold plated onto it. About 10 kilograms of gold and about 736 kilograms of bronze are needed for the Tokyo Games. About 1,230 kilograms of silver, nearly double the amount of bronze, is estimated to be needed. Since April last year, the organizing committee, the Environment Ministry, the Tokyo metropolitan government and others have been collecting small electronic devices such as old smartphones and personal computers. As of March this year, at the halfway point to the collection deadline, half the necessary bronze had been collected. Since gold and silver are still being refined, the specific amounts that have been collected are unknown.However, “Given the collection pace of bronze, we are significantly short of silver, which we need twice as much of as bronze,” an official of the organizing committee said. Collection boxes for smartphones and small electronic devices are installed at outlets of NTT Docomo Inc., which is participating in the project, across the nation. There are also boxes in municipal government buildings, mainly in Tokyo. At NTT Docomo outlets, it is estimated that a total of 3.2 million smartphones have been collected over the past year, surpassing the annual average of 3 million until the previous year. The number of municipal governments with collection points increased from 624 at the beginning of the collection to 1,404 in March this year. The project has spread nationwide. However, at the current pace, the organizers likely will run short of silver. Therefore, the organizing committee newly installed collection boxes at 3,000 locations across the nation, mainly such as post offices, from late March this year. From here on, they plan to install more collection points and strengthen promotional activities in cooperation with universities and department stores, aiming to accelerate the pace of collection over the remaining year. “Just like the recycling of plastic bottles and empty cans, we aim to achieve a society where the separate collection of electronic devices is natural,” an official of the organizing committee said. “To take advantage of the Tokyo Games to achieve this, we want to call for many people to cooperate with us.”
Sports An official with the Gelora Bunga Karno (GBK) sports complex management has denied a statement made by online shop Blibli that Istora Senayan indoor stadium now bears a new name, Blibli arena, saying that the negotiation between two parties is still far from final. “We haven’t reached any agreement regarding the name change. We haven’t decided anything,” GBK infrastructure and business development director Gatot Tetuko said on Monday as quoted by kompas.com. Gatot further explained that everything was still on the negotiation table between all stakeholders despite the goodwill shown by the private company. He, however, acknowledged that a name-change was part of the deal for the contribution made by the private sector in helping GBK management in maintaining facilities. “We have invited the private sector to make a contribution. The funds will be used solely for the sports facility maintenance,” he said. He also mentioned that besides Blibli, there were many private companies that had shown an interest in name-change deals for other sport facilities located within the compound.   Previously, in a press release received by The Jakarta Post on Monday, Blibli had announced its participation as the main sponsor of the upcoming 2018 Indonesian Open, which will be held from July 3 until 8. At the same time, it also mentioned that the name of Istora Senayan would be changed to the Blibli Arena.  Blibli.com CEO Kusumo Nartatanto said without further elaboration that the venue’s name change was a result of support given by his company for positive activities in the country. Blibli has made no comment regarding the denial.
Sports Marc Marquez won his home Spanish Grand Prix and took the overall MotoGP lead on Sunday after the reigning champion's main rivals collided spectacularly. The Honda rider was in a race of his own for the last eight laps after the Ducati pairing of Andrea Dovizioso, the previous championship leader, and Jorge Lorenzo collided with Honda's Dani Pedrosa while fighting for second place. Pedrosa, who underwent wrist surgery less than a month ago, was thrown high over his bike and onto the asphalt after trying to go past the two Ducatis on the inside of the sunny Jerez circuit in southern Spain. Lorenzo came across into the corner as Dovizioso went wide, colliding with Pedrosa and sending the two Ducatis into the gravel. All three riders walked away from the crash, although Pedrosa complained of severe pain in his right hip. French Tech3 Yamaha rider Johann Zarco was gifted the runner-up slot, 5.241 seconds behind, and is now Marquez's closest rival in the championship. Italian Andrea Iannone finished third for Suzuki. Four-times world champion Marquez, who started the race from fifth place and took the lead with 16 laps to go, now has 70 points after four races to Zarco's 58. Dovizioso dropped to fifth overall with 46. "I was convinced before the race that I was able to win," said Marquez, who had a big wobble when he ran over gravel left on the track by an earlier off. "Ok, we started on the second row but anyway today I was clever. I pushed...here the race is very long and you must manage many things." Italian great Valentino Rossi was fifth in a race that saw him reach a career milestone by completing the circumference of the planet in race kilometres. Rossi has now covered 40,075km in competition over 23 seasons, starting at the 1996 Malaysian Grand Prix. Britain's Cal Crutchlow started on pole position for the LCR Honda team but failed to finish, crashing out at turn one after nine laps and while in fourth place. Dovizioso felt he was the innocent party in the three-way crash, blaming Pedrosa for the 'biggest mistake' although the Spaniard disagreed. "Were the other guys on the outside coming back from a mistake, re-joining the right line? Yes. So who has the preference in this case, the guy who is inside or those who are outside? The one on the inside. So, who was at fault?" he asked. 
Sports It took three weeks for Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany to finally get his hands on the Premier League trophy but, on a day of celebrations at the Etihad, a goalless draw may  have left Huddersfield Town as the big winners. A strong showing from the struggling visitors earned a valuable point which may be enough to keep them in the Premier League for a second season, an impressive achievement given their limited resources. They also frustrated the bid by Pep Guardiola's runaway champions to set new Premier League records for the most goals, points and wins in a season -- all marks which could yet be claimed by City in the season's final week in which they play Brighton and Southampton. But, after a delay while uninvited supporters were removed from the field, Guardiola was finally able to see his team presented with the trophy which marks the third major country in which he has managed a team to a title following successes in Spain and Germany with Barcelona and Bayern Munich. "England is a special place and is so tough," Guardiola told Sky Sports. "Today we saw it. You never know if you are going to win, but I had no doubt what I had to do. "You win or lose, you have to try and do what you believe. Today was proof we can do better. "We lost a bit of focus, but that is normal. To make back-to-back titles in this league will be tough, but we accept the challenge." The celebrations for City's third title in seven seasons began well before kick-off, both inside and outside their Etihad home ground. Supporters were issued with blue and white flags to greet the champions as they were given yet another guard of honour on their way onto the field before kick-off. They were also met by the survivors of City's famous 1968 title-winning side, a squad led by club legends Colin Bell, Francis Lee and Mike Summerbee who were all on hand to receive an emotional welcome from fans who remember their feats half a century on. These title celebrations have been curiously drawn out. This time there was none of the edge-of-the-seat drama that so famously brought City their first Premier League title, when Sergio Aguero scored with virtually the last kick of the season against QPR in 2012. City won the league three weeks earlier without playing when closest rivals Manchester United surprisingly lost at home to West Brom. Since then City have enjoyed comfortable wins over Swansea and West Ham, but on Sunday there was no hint of Huddersfield showing the champions too much respect when the contest finally kicked off. Victory would have guaranteed Huddersfield safety and another season of top flight football. David Wagner's men might have been on course for just such an upset result in an entertaining, if goalless, first half but Ederson denied Florent Hadergjonaj and Alex Pritchard. A City side that had been held goalless in just one previous league game -- a draw at Crystal Palace on New Year’s Eve -- inevitably carved out chances of their own with Jonas Lossl saving well at David Silva’s feet after five minutes and, unknowingly, stopping a fierce Kevin De Bruyne shot. By the interval, Huddersfield were visibly wilting in the Manchester heat and facing the prospect of a long second half of attrition. City started brightly, with Christopher Schindler clearing off his line from a scramble at a Leroy Sane corner, but otherwise Huddersfield defended manfully and substitute Scott Malone might even have snatched a dramatic injury-time winner for the visitors. But Guardiola's heartfelt congratulations to his opposite number Wagner on the final whistle, demonstrated the importance of the point to the visitors who now join Everton and Manchester United as the only sides to have avoided defeat at the Etihad in the league this season.
Sports Spaniard Marc Marquez (Honda) flew past the chequered flag way ahead of his rivals in the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez de la Frontera on Sunday, climbing atop the MotoGp championship standings in the process. Frenchman Johann Zarco on his Yamaha Tech3 finished over five seconds adrift of the world champion in second while Andrea Iannone of Suzuki was third at 8.214sec. Zarco climbed to second in the standings with 58 points behind Marquez on 70 while Italian Iannone gained  a second consecutive podium spot that took him to fourth on 48. The race was marked by crashes that took out several of the chief contenders including British pole sitter Cal Crutchlow of Honda, Spaniards Dani Pedrosa and Jorge Lorenzo and the Italian Andrea Dovizioso who had led the championship going into the race. Lorenzo, Dovizioso and Pedrosa looked destined to fight for the win but all fell in a turn six collision just as Marquez, who started from the second row, had pulled slightly ahead with seven laps still remaining. Race commissioners decided there had been no infringement as Marquez tore away and Zarco swept past the stricken trio. "I really never believed I could win this race from the second row. But I was clever and pushed it. It's a long race with many different things to bear in mind," Marquez said. Zarco thanked his lucky stars after the race. "Sometimes you need a little luck and today I got some," said the Frenchman. "When the three of them fell I could hardly believe it." "I said to myself 'keep calm there's only seven laps left' and these 20 points are great for the championship," he said. Danilo Petrucci was fourth at 8.617sec and the veteran Italian Valentino Rossi was fifth right on his tail.
Sports Arsene Wenger will bid farewell to a stadium he helped to build in more ways than one when he leads Arsenal at the Emirates for the final time at home to Burnley on Sunday. Wenger's final season after 22 years in charge is destined to end in disappointment after Thursday's Europa League semi-final exit to Atletico Madrid. Sixth-placed Arsenal are already out of the running for a top-four finish, and could even finish below their visitors this weekend in seventh with a poor return from Wenger's final three games in charge. Tributes will be paid to the Frenchman at full-time on Sunday with Arsenal's players even embarking on an end of season lap of honour. Once again, though, it will be a parade without a trophy as it often has been since Arsenal moved to the Emirates in 2006. The success Wenger produced in his first decade at the club, winning two doubles and 'The Invincibles' unbeaten season on course to another Premier League triumph in 2003/04, created the demand to move to a 60,000-capacity stadium from Highbury. However, whilst the Emirates was intended to give Arsenal the financial resources in the long term to compete with not just England's, but Europe's elite, it significantly hampered Wenger's ability to challenge in the short term. Wenger claimed it was his commitment to remain with the club that helped to secure bank loans needed to build the stadium. He was so tied to the move, Wenger even helped in the design of some parts of the stadium such as the dressing rooms. - 'Most difficult period' - However, once the move had taken place, Wenger was often forced to sell his best players to pay back those loans at the same time huge investment poured into Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United. "In 2006 the most difficult period of my life started. We had restricted finances, we had to pay back a huge amount of money and we had to sell our best players," Wenger told BT Sport ahead of last season's FA Cup final.  "That was, for me, the biggest period of pressure between 2006 and 2014. If you told me today I’d do that again I would say ‘no thank you, I’ll leave that to someone else.’" By the time Arsenal were ready to join in the arms race in the last four years, the Gunners were playing catch up and Wenger too far stuck in his ways to enact the change that was needed. Wenger is finally leaving the job to someone else, albeit it seems against his better judgement having admitted the timing of his departure "was not really my decision". He also claimed he was going to help unite a fan base that has grown increasingly frustrated at his inability to mould a team capable of contending to win the Premier League. That has been reflected in dwindling attendances at the Emirates in recent months. On Sunday, though, the Arsenal fans have one final chance to gather and thank the most successful ever manager in the stadium that stands for the legacy he leaves behind.
Sports A Mexican factory is churning out rubber Neymars, Messis and Ronaldos ahead of the World Cup, racing to meet demand for life-like masks of a dream team of football giants. An eclectic lineup rounds out the roster of 12 famous football faces being immortalized in latex at the Grupo Rev factory in the city of Jiutepec, in central Mexico: retired legends Pele, Diego Maradona and Zinedine Zidane, current stars Luis Suarez, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Franck Ribery, and Mexican favorites Javier "Chicharito" Hernandez, Hirving "Chucky" Lozano and Jorge Campos. "A lot of people have been asking for our masks because they're planning to go to the World Cup," said Diego Esponda, an executive at the company. "Mexican fans always stand out for putting on the biggest party, and we think these masks are an accessory that's going to get a lot of attention," he told AFP in the factory's design studio. To select the factory's dream team, workers held a World Cup-style "qualifying round" to narrow down an initial field of 20 candidates, said Esponda. They consulted family and friends to decide on the most recognized and popular players. "(Lionel) Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo are the most requested. In Mexico, Chicharito is also in high demand," he said. The masks retail for about $13 each. The factory made an initial run of 1,000 each for Barcelona star Messi and Real Madrid's Ronaldo -- and they are almost sold out already. The other footballers got runs of 200 to 500 masks each, for a total of about 6,000. Workers mostly make the masks by hand. First they sculpt the faces in clay, then make a plaster mold, then cast the masks in latex and hand-paint them. "There's very little machinery involved -- about 15 percent of the process," said Esponda. The masks are mostly aimed at the Mexican market, but the company has received orders from Spain, France, Sweden and the United States, he said. he factory, which made more than a million masks last year, is also selling likenesses of Mexican politicians in the run-up to the country's July 1 elections.
Sports Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has promised not to stand in the way of long-time assistant Rui Faria should he pursue ambitions of becoming a manager in his own right. United's bitter rivals Liverpool secured their place in the Champions League final on Wednesday after a turbulent week that saw Jurgen Klopp's assistant for the past 17 years, Zeljko Buvac, leave the club. Buvac now leads the betting to become the man to succeed Arsene Wenger as Arsenal manager at the end of the season, a role Faria has also been linked with. Faria, like Mourinho, never played top-level football, but became a significant part of Mourinho's coaching staff after meeting the future United manager during a seminar day at Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium in 2000. At the time, Mourinho was assistant to Louis van Gaal at Barcelona but, when he became a manager in his own right at Portuguese club Uniao de Leiria in 2001, he took Faria on as his fitness coach, and the two remained together for spells at Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. However, Faria's touchline antics have also made him a controversial figure. In 2014 he was handed a four-game stadium ban for using abusive language towards the officials in a shock 2-1 home defeat for Chelsea at the hands of Sunderland. "You ask me if I think it would be a good fit and I say 'yes'. And I say it because he is more than my assistant, he is my friend," said Mourinho of Faria's credentials for the Arsenal job. "If my friend has the possibility one day of a big job, I would help him to pack and to carry the bags and to wish him luck. "So if one day that is going to happen, the first one to be happy would probably be myself because I met him when he was a kid in his university and we were together for 18 years." - Martial, Rashford 'trusted' - Mourinho also said he has full trust in both Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford to play up front as Romelu Lukaku recovers from an ankle injury. The Belgium striker is recovering from a knock sustained during last weekend’s 2-1 win over Arsenal and is facing a battle to get fit for the FA Cup final against Chelsea on May 19. Martial's long-term future has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks, as he has completed 90 minutes in the Premier League just once since February 11. Reports from his native France in April suggested that Martial wanted to leave Old Trafford, having seen his opportunities to play restricted since the arrival of Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal in January. The forward’s place in France's World Cup squad is far from assured, given that coach Didier Deschamps has significant attacking options and did not select him for their decisive qualifiers against Bulgaria and Belarus last autumn. Rashford has made only two Premier League starts in 2018, although Mourinho has made clear in the past that he does not feel the forward needs to be playing regularly at club level to ensure a place in England’s squad for the finals in Russia. "They have had limited opportunities because Romelu has played all the games this season," said Mourinho of United's top scorer, who has netted 27 times in his debut season at Old Trafford. "He was playing well and was playing the way I wanted him to play and has had no injuries, no suspensions. But I do trust them, no problem."
